1This preoccupation with Rousseau is after all easy to explain.
It ishis somewhat formidable privilege to represent more fully than anyother one person a great international movement.
To attack Rousseau orto defend him is most often only a way of attacking or defending thismovement.
It is from this point of view at all events that the present work isconceived.
I have not undertaken a systematic study of Rousseau’s lifeand doctrines.
The appearance of his name in my title is justified,if at all, simply because he comes at a fairly early stage in theinternational movement the rise and growth of which I am tracing, andhas on the whole supplied me with the most significant illustrations ofit.
I have already put forth certain views regarding this movement inthree previous volumes.
2 Though each one of these volumes attempts todo justice to a particular topic, it is at the same time intended to bea link in a continuous argument.
I hope that I may be allowed to speakhere with some frankness of the main trend of this argument both on itsnegative and on its positive, or constructive, side.
Perhaps the best key to both sides of my argument is found in thelines of Emerson I have taken as epigraph for “Literature and theAmerican College”:    There are two laws discrete    Not reconciled,--    Law for man, and law for thing;    The last builds town and fleet,    But it runs wild,    And doth the man unking.
On its negative side my argument is directed against this undueemphasis on the “law for thing,” against the attempt to erect onnaturalistic foundations a complete philosophy of life.
I define twomain forms of naturalism--on the one hand, utilitarian and scientificand, on the other, emotional naturalism.
The type of romanticism I amstudying is inseparably bound up with emotional naturalism.
This type of romanticism encouraged by the naturalistic movement isonly one of three main types I distinguish and I am dealing for themost part with only one aspect of it.
But even when thus circumscribedthe subject can scarcely be said to lack importance; for if I am rightin my conviction as to the unsoundness of a Rousseauistic philosophy oflife, it follows that the total tendency of the Occident at present isaway from rather than towards civilization.
On the positive side, my argument aims to reassert the “law for man,”and its special discipline against the various forms of naturalisticexcess.
At the very mention of the word discipline I shall be set downin certain quarters as reactionary.
But does it necessarily followfrom a plea for the human law that one is a reactionary or in generala traditionalist? An American writer of distinction was once heard toremark that he saw in the world to-day but two classes of persons,--themossbacks and the mountebanks, and that for his part he preferred tobe a mossback.
One should think twice before thus consenting to seem amere relic of the past.
The ineffable smartness of our young radicalsis due to the conviction that, whatever else they may be, they are thevery pink of modernity.
Before sharing their conviction it might bewell to do a little preliminary defining of such terms as modern andthe modern spirit.
It may then turn out that the true difficulty withour young radicals is not that they are too modern but that they arenot modern enough.
For, though the word modern is often and no doubtinevitably used to describe the more recent or the most recent thing,this is not its sole use.
It is not in this sense alone that the wordis used by writers like Goethe and Sainte-Beuve and Renan and Arnold.
What all these writers mean by the modern spirit is the positive andcritical spirit, the spirit that refuses to take things on authority.
This is what Renan means, for example, when he calls Petrarch the“founder of the modern spirit in literature,” or Arnold when heexplains why the Greeks of the great period seem more modern to us thanthe men of the Middle Ages.
3Now what I have myself tried to do is to be thoroughly modern in thissense.
I hold that one should not only welcome the efforts of theman of science at his best to put the natural law on a positive andcritical basis, but that one should strive to emulate him in one’sdealings with the human law; and so become a complete positivist.
Mymain objection to the movement I am studying is that it has failed toproduce complete positivists.
Instead of facing honestly the emergencycreated by its break with the past the leaders of this movement haveinclined to deny the duality of human nature, and then sought todissimulate this mutilation of man under a mass of intellectual andemotional sophistry.
The proper procedure in refuting these incompletepositivists is not to appeal to some dogma or outer authority butrather to turn against them their own principles.
Thus Diderot, anotable example of the incomplete positivist and a chief source ofnaturalistic tendency, says that “everything is experimental in man.
Now the word experimental has somewhat narrowed in meaning since thetime of Diderot.
If one takes the saying to mean that everything in manis a matter of experience one should accept it unreservedly and thenplant oneself firmly on the facts of experience that Diderot and otherincomplete positivists have refused to recognize.
The man who plants himself, not on outer authority but on experience,is an individualist.
To be modern in the sense I have defined is notonly to be positive and critical, but also--and this from the time ofPetrarch--to be individualistic.
The establishment of a sound typeof individualism is indeed the specifically modern problem.
It isright here that the failure of the incomplete positivist, the man whois positive only according to the natural law, is most conspicuous.
What prevails in the region of the natural law is endless change andrelativity; therefore the naturalistic positivist attacks all thetraditional creeds and dogmas for the very reason that they aspire tofixity.
Now all the ethical values of civilization have been associatedwith these fixed beliefs; and so it has come to pass that with theirundermining by naturalism the ethical values themselves are in dangerof being swept away in the everlasting flux.
Because the individualwho views life positively must give up unvarying creeds and dogmas“anterior, exterior, and superior” to himself, it has been assumedthat he must also give up standards.
For standards imply an element ofoneness somewhere, with reference to which it is possible to measurethe mere manifoldness and change.
The naturalistic individualist,however, refuses to recognize any such element of oneness.
His ownprivate and personal self is to be the measure of all things and thismeasure itself, he adds, is constantly changing.
But to stop at thisstage is to be satisfied with the most dangerous of half-truths.
Thus Bergson’s assertion that “life is a perpetual gushing forth ofnovelties” is in itself only a dangerous half-truth of this kind.
Theconstant element in life is, no less than the element of novelty andchange, a matter of observation and experience.
As the French have it,the more life changes the more it is the same thing.
If, then, one is to be a sound individualist, an individualist withhuman standards--and in an age like this that has cut loose from itstraditional moorings, the very survival of civilization would seem tohinge on its power to produce such a type of individualist--one mustgrapple with what Plato terms the problem of the One and the Many.
My own solution of this problem, it may be well to point out, is notpurely Platonic.
Because one can perceive immediately an elementof unity in things, it does not follow that one is justified inestablishing a world of essences or entities or “ideas” above the flux.
To do this is to fall away from a positive and critical into a moreor less speculative attitude; it is to risk setting up a metaphysicof the One.
Those who put exclusive emphasis on the element of changein things are in no less obvious danger of falling away from thepositive and critical attitude into a metaphysic of the Many.
4 Thisfor example is the error one finds in the contemporary thinkers whoseem to have the cry, thinkers like James and Bergson and Dewey andCroce.
They are very far from satisfying the requirements of a completepositivism; they are seeking rather to build up their own intoxicationwith the element of change into a complete view of life, and so areturning their backs on one whole side of experience in a way that oftenreminds one of the ancient Greek sophists.
The history of philosophysince the Greeks is to a great extent the history of the clashes of themetaphysicians of the One and the metaphysicians of the Many.
In theeyes of the complete positivist this history therefore reduces itselflargely to a monstrous logomachy.
Life does not give here an element of oneness and there an element ofchange.
It gives a oneness that is always changing.
The oneness andthe change are inseparable.
Now if what is stable and permanent is feltas real, the side of life that is always slipping over into somethingelse or vanishing away entirely is, as every student of psychologyknows, associated rather with the feeling of illusion.
If a manattends solely to this side of life he will finally come, like Lecontede Lisle, to look upon it as a “torrent of mobile chimeras,” as an“endless whirl of vain appearances.
To admit that the oneness of lifeand the change are inseparable is therefore to admit that such realityas man can know positively is inextricably mixed up with illusion.
Moreover man does not observe the oneness that is always changing fromthe outside; he is a part of the process, he is himself a oneness thatis always changing.
Though imperceptible at any particular moment, thecontinuous change that is going on leads to differences--those, let ussay, between a human individual at the age of six weeks and the sameindividual at the age of seventy--which are sufficiently striking: andfinally this human oneness that is always changing seems to vanishaway entirely.
From all this it follows that an enormous elementof illusion--and this is a truth the East has always accepted morereadily than the West--enters into the idea of personality itself.
Ifthe critical spirit is once allowed to have its way, it will not restcontent until it has dissolved life into a mist of illusion.
Perhapsthe most positive and critical account of man in modern literature isthat of Shakespeare:                We are such stuff    As dreams are made on, and our little life    Is rounded with a sleep.
But, though strictly considered, life is but a web of illusion and adream within a dream, it is a dream that needs to be managed with theutmost discretion, if it is not to turn into a nightmare.
In otherwords, however much life may mock the metaphysician, the problem ofconduct remains.
There is always the unity at the heart of the change;it is possible, however, to get at this real and abiding element andso at the standards with reference to which the dream of life may berightly managed only through a veil of illusion.
The problem of theOne and the Many, the ultimate problem of thought, can therefore besolved only by a right use of illusion.
In close relation to illusionand the questions that arise in connection with it is all that wehave come to sum up in the word imagination.
The use of this word, atleast in anything like its present extension, is, one should note,comparatively recent.
Whole nations and periods of the past canscarcely be said to have had any word corresponding to imagination inthis extended sense.
Yet the thinkers of the past have treated, attimes profoundly, under the head of fiction or illusion the questionsthat we should treat under the head of imagination.
5 In the “Mastersof Modern French Criticism” I was above all preoccupied with theproblem of the One and the Many and the failure of the nineteenthcentury to deal with it adequately.
My effort in this present work isto show that this failure can be retrieved only by a deeper insightinto the imagination and its all-important rôle in both literatureand life.
Man is cut off from immediate contact with anything abidingand therefore worthy to be called real, and condemned to live in anelement of fiction or illusion, but he may, I have tried to show, layhold with the aid of the imagination on the element of oneness thatis inextricably blended with the manifoldness and change and to justthat extent may build up a sound model for imitation.
One tends tobe an individualist with true standards, to put the matter somewhatdifferently, only in so far as one understands the relation betweenappearance and reality--what the philosophers call the epistemologicalproblem.
This problem, though it cannot be solved abstractly andmetaphysically, can be solved practically and in terms of actualconduct.
Inasmuch as modern philosophy has failed to work out any suchsolution, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that modern philosophy isbankrupt, not merely from Kant, but from Descartes.
The supreme maxim of the ethical positivist is: By their fruits shallye know them.
If I object to a romantic philosophy it is because I donot like its fruits.
I infer from its fruits that this philosophy hasmade a wrong use of illusion.
All those who took the romantic promisesat their face value,” says Bourget, “rolled in abysses of despair andennui.
6 If any one still holds, as many of the older romanticistsheld, that it is a distinguished thing to roll in abysses of despairand ennui, he should read me no further.
He will have no sympathy withmy point of view.
If any one, on the other hand, accepts my criterionbut denies that Rousseauistic living has such fruits, it has been myaim so to accumulate evidence that he will be confronted with the taskof refuting not a set of theories but a body of facts.
My whole method,let me repeat, is experimental, or it might be less ambiguous to say ifthe word were a fortunate one, experiential.
The illustrations I havegiven of any particular aspect of the movement are usually only a smallfraction of those I have collected--themselves no doubt only a fractionof the illustrations that might be collected from printed sources.
M.
Maigron’s investigation7 into the fruits of romantic living suggeststhe large additions that might be made to these printed sources frommanuscript material.
My method indeed is open in one respect to grave misunderstanding.
From the fact that I am constantly citing passages from this or thatauthor and condemning the tendency for which these passages stand,the reader will perhaps be led to infer a total condemnation of theauthors so quoted.
But the inference may be very incorrect.
I amnot trying to give rounded estimates of individuals--delightful andlegitimate as that type of criticism is--but to trace main currents asa part of my search for a set of principles to oppose to naturalism.
I call attention for example to the Rousseauistic and primitivisticelements in Wordsworth but do not assert that this is the wholetruth about Wordsworth.
One’s views as to the philosophical valueof Rousseauism must, however, weigh heavily in a total judgment ofWordsworth.
Criticism is such a difficult art because one must notonly have principles but must apply them flexibly and intuitively.
Noone would accuse criticism at present of lacking flexibility.
It hasgrown so flexible in fact as to become invertebrate.
One of my reasonsfor practicing the present type of criticism, is the conviction thatbecause of a lack of principles the type of criticism that aims atrounded estimates of individuals is rapidly ceasing to have any meaning.
I should add that if I had attempted rounded estimates they would oftenhave been more favorable than might be gathered from my comments hereand elsewhere on the romantic leaders.
One is justified in leaningtowards severity in the laying down of principles, but should nearlyalways incline to indulgence in the application of them.
In a sense onemay say with Goethe that the excellencies are of the individual, thedefects of the age.
It is especially needful to recall distinctionsof this kind in the case of Rousseau himself and my treatment of him.
M.
Lanson has dwelt on the strange duality of Rousseau’s nature.
The writer,” he says, “is a poor dreamy creature who approachesaction only with alarm and with every manner of precaution, and whounderstands the applications of his boldest doctrines in a way toreassure conservatives and satisfy opportunists.
But the work for itspart detaches itself from the author, lives its independent life,and, heavily charged with revolutionary explosives which neutralizethe moderate and conciliatory elements Rousseau has put into it forhis own satisfaction, it exasperates and inspires revolt and firesenthusiasms and irritates hatreds; it is the mother of violence, thesource of all that is uncompromising, it launches the simple soulswho give themselves up to its strange virtue upon the desperate questof the absolute, an absolute to be realized now by anarchy and now bysocial despotism.
8 I am inclined to discover in the Rousseau who,according to M.
Lanson, is merely timorous, a great deal of shrewdnessand at times something even better than shrewdness.
The question isnot perhaps very important, for M.
Lanson is surely right in affirmingthat the Rousseau who has moved the world--and that for reasons I shalltry to make plain--is Rousseau the extremist and foe of compromise;and so it is to this Rousseau that as a student of main tendencies Idevote almost exclusive attention.
I am not, however, seeking to makea scapegoat even of the radical and revolutionary Rousseau.
One ofmy chief objections, indeed, to Rousseauism, as will appear in thefollowing pages, is that it encourages the making of scapegoats.
If I am opposed to Rousseauism because of its fruits in experience, Itry to put what I have to offer as a substitute on the same positivebasis.
Now experience is of many degrees: first of all one’s purelypersonal experience, an infinitesimal fragment; and then the experienceof one’s immediate circle, of one’s time and country, of the near pastand so on in widening circles.
The past which as dogma the ethicalpositivist rejects, as experience he not only admits but welcomes.
Hecan no more dispense with it indeed than the naturalistic positivistcan dispense with his laboratory.
He insists moreover on includingthe remoter past in his survey.
Perhaps the most pernicious of allthe conceits fostered by the type of progress we owe to science isthe conceit that we have outgrown this older experience.
One shouldendeavor, as Goethe says, to oppose to the aberrations of the hour, themasses of universal history.
There are special reasons just now whythis background to which one appeals should not be merely Occidental.
An increasing material contact between the Occident and the Far Eastis certain.
We should be enlightened by this time as to the perilsof material contact between men and bodies of men who have no deeperunderstanding.
Quite apart from this consideration the experience ofthe Far East completes and confirms in a most interesting way that ofthe Occident.
We can scarcely afford to neglect it if we hope to workout a truly ecumenical wisdom to oppose to the sinister one-sidednessof our current naturalism.
Now the ethical experience of the Far Eastmay be summed up for practical purposes in the teachings and influenceof two men, Confucius and Buddha.
9 To know the Buddhistic andConfucian teachings in their true spirit is to know what is best andmost representative in the ethical experience of about half the humanrace for over seventy generations.
A study of Buddha and Confucius suggests, as does a study of the greatteachers of the Occident, that under its bewildering surface varietyhuman experience falls after all into a few main categories.
I myselfam fond of distinguishing three levels on which a man may experiencelife--the naturalistic, the humanistic, and the religious.
Tested byits fruits Buddhism at its best confirms Christianity.
Submitted to thesame test Confucianism falls in with the teaching of Aristotle and ingeneral with that of all those who from the Greeks down have proclaimeddecorum and the law of measure.
This is so obviously true thatConfucius has been called the Aristotle of the East.
Not only has theFar East had in Buddhism a great religious movement and in Confucianisma great humanistic movement, it has also had in early Taoism10 amovement that in its attempts to work out naturalistic equivalents ofhumanistic or religious insight, offers almost startling analogies tothe movement I am here studying.
Thus both East and West have not only had great religious andhumanistic disciplines which when tested by their fruits confirm oneanother, bearing witness to the element of oneness, the constantelement in human experience, but these disciplines have at timesbeen conceived in a very positive spirit.
Confucius indeed, though amoral realist, can scarcely be called a positivist; he aimed ratherto attach men to the past by links of steel.
He reminds us in this asin some other ways of the last of the great Tories in the Occident,Dr.
Johnson.
Buddha on the other hand was an individualist.
He wishedmen to rest their belief neither on his authority11 nor on thatof tradition.
12 No one has ever made a more serious effort to putreligion on a positive and critical basis.
It is only proper that Iacknowledge my indebtedness to the great Hindu positivist: my treatmentof the problem of the One and the Many, for example, is nearer toBuddha than to Plato.
Yet even if the general thesis be granted that itis desirable to put the “law for man” on a positive and critical basis,the question remains whether the more crying need just now is forpositive and critical humanism or for positive and critical religion.
I have discussed this delicate and difficult question more fully in mylast chapter, but may give at least one reason here for inclining tothe humanistic solution.
I have been struck in my study of the pastby the endless self-deception to which man is subject when he triesto pass too abruptly from the naturalistic to the religious level.
The world, it is hard to avoid concluding, would have been a betterplace if more persons had made sure they were human before settingout to be superhuman; and this consideration would seem to apply withspecial force to a generation like the present that is wallowing inthe trough of naturalism.
After all to be a good humanist is merely tobe moderate and sensible and decent.
It is much easier for a man todeceive himself and others regarding his supernatural lights than it isregarding the degree to which he is moderate and sensible and decent.
The past is not without examples of a positive and critical humanism.
Ihave already mentioned Aristotle.
If by his emphasis on the mediatoryvirtues he reminds one of Confucius, by his positive method andintensely analytical temper he reminds one rather of Buddha.
WhenAristotle rises to the religious level and discourses of the “life ofvision” he is very Buddhistic.
When Buddha for his part turns from thereligious life to the duties of the layman he is purely Aristotelian.
Aristotle also deals positively with the natural law.
He is indeed acomplete positivist, and not, like the man of the nineteenth century,positive according to the natural law alone.
The Aristotle thatshould specially concern us, however, is the positive and criticalhumanist--the Aristotle, let us say, of the “Ethics” and “Politics” and“Poetics.
Just as I have called the point of view of the scientificand utilitarian naturalist Baconian,13 and that of the emotionalnaturalist Rousseauistic, so I would term the point of view that Iam myself seeking to develop Aristotelian.
Aristotle has laid downonce for all the principle that should guide the ethical positivist.
Truth,” he says, “in matters of moral action is judged from facts andfrom actual life.
So what we should do is to examine the precedingstatements of Solon and other wise men by referring them to factsand to actual life, and when they harmonize with facts we may acceptthem, when they are at variance with them conceive of them as meretheories.
14It is in this sense alone that I aspire to be called an Aristotelian;for one risks certain misunderstandings in using the name ofAristotle.
15 The authority of this great positivist has been invokedinnumerable times throughout the ages as a substitute for directobservation.
Aristotle was not only the prop and mainstay of dogmafor centuries during the Middle Ages, but dogmatic Aristotelianismsurvived to no small extent, especially in literature, throughout theneo-classical period.
It was no doubt natural enough that the championsof the modern spirit should have rejected Aristotle along with thetraditional order of which he had been made a support.
Yet if they hadbeen more modern they might have seen in him rather a chief precursor.
They might have learned from him how to have standards and at the sametime not be immured in dogma.
As it is, those who call themselvesmodern have come to adopt a purely exploratory attitude towards life.
On desperate seas long wont to roam,” they have lost more and morethe sense of what is normal and central in human experience.
But toget away from what is normal and central is to get away from wisdom.
My whole argument on the negative side, if I may venture on a finalsumming up, is that the naturalistic movement in the midst of whichwe are still living had from the start this taint of eccentricity.
Ihave tried to show in detail the nature of the aberration.
As for theresults, they are being written large in disastrous events.
On itsconstructive side, my argument, if it makes any appeal at all, willbe to those for whom the symbols through which the past has receivedits wisdom have become incredible, and who, seeing at the same timethat the break with the past that took place in the eighteenth centurywas on unsound lines, hold that the remedy for the partial positivismthat is the source of this unsoundness, is a more complete positivism.
Nothing is more perilous than to be only half critical.
This is torisk being the wrong type of individualist--the individualist who hasrepudiated outer control without achieving inner control.
People meannowadays by a philosopher,” says Rivarol, “not the man who learns thegreat art of mastering his passions or adding to his insight, butthe man who has cast off prejudices without acquiring virtues.
Thatview of philosophy has not ceased to be popular.
The whole modernexperiment is threatened with breakdown simply because it has not beensufficiently modern.
One should therefore not rest content until onehas, with the aid of the secular experience of both the East and theWest, worked out a point of view so modern that, compared with it, thatof our young radicals will seem antediluvian.
ROUSSEAU AND ROMANTICISMCHAPTER ITHE TERMS CLASSIC AND ROMANTICThe words classic and romantic, we are often told, cannot be definedat all, and even if they could be defined, some would add, we shouldnot be much profited.
But this inability or unwillingness to define mayitself turn out to be only one aspect of a movement that from Rousseauto Bergson has sought to discredit the analytical intellect--whatWordsworth calls “the false secondary power by which we multiplydistinctions.
However, those who are with Socrates rather than withRousseau or Wordsworth in this matter, will insist on the importanceof definition, especially in a chaotic era like the present; fornothing is more characteristic of such an era than its irresponsibleuse of general terms.
Now to measure up to the Socratic standard, adefinition must not be abstract and metaphysical, but experimental;it must not, that is, reflect our opinion of what a word should mean,but what it actually has meant.
Mathematicians may be free at timesto frame their own definitions, but in the case of words like classicand romantic, that have been used innumerable times, and used not inone but in many countries, such a method is inadmissible.
One mustkeep one’s eye on actual usage.
One should indeed allow for a certainamount of freakishness in this usage.
Beaumarchais, for example, makesclassic synonymous with barbaric.
16 One may disregard an occasionalaberration of this kind, but if one can find only confusion andinconsistency in all the main uses of words like classic and romantic,the only procedure for those who speak or write in order to beunderstood is to banish the words from their vocabulary.
Now to define in a Socratic way two things are necessary: one mustlearn to see a common element in things that are apparently differentand also to discriminate between things that are apparently similar.
A Newton, to take the familiar instance of the former process, saw acommon element in the fall of an apple and the motion of a planet;and one may perhaps without being a literary Newton discover a commonelement in all the main uses of the word romantic as well as in allthe main uses of the word classic; though some of the things to whichthe word romantic in particular has been applied seem, it must beadmitted, at least as far apart as the fall of an apple and the motionof a planet.
The first step is to perceive the something that connectstwo or more of these things apparently so diverse, and then it may befound necessary to refer this unifying trait itself back to somethingstill more general, and so on until we arrive, not indeed at anythingabsolute--the absolute will always elude us--but at what Goethe callsthe original or underlying phenomenon (Urphänomen).
A fruitful sourceof false definition is to take as primary in a more or less closelyallied group of facts what is actually secondary--for example, to fixupon the return to the Middle Ages as the central fact in romanticism,whereas this return is only symptomatic; it is very far from being theoriginal phenomenon.
Confused and incomplete definitions of romanticismhave indeed just that origin--they seek to put at the centre somethingthat though romantic is not central but peripheral, and so the wholesubject is thrown out of perspective.
My plan then is to determine to the best of my ability, in connectionwith a brief historical survey, the common element in the various usesof the words classic and romantic; and then, having thus disposed ofthe similarities, to turn to the second part of the art of definingand deal, also historically, with the differences.
For my subject isnot romanticism in general, but only a particular type of romanticism,and this type of romanticism needs to be seen as a recoil, not fromclassicism in general, but from a particular type of classicism.
IThe word romantic when traced historically is found to go back tothe old French roman of which still elder forms are romans andromant.
These and similar formations derive ultimately from themediæval Latin adverb romanice.
Roman and like words meantoriginally the various vernaculars derived from Latin, just as theFrench still speak of these vernaculars as les langues romanes;and then the word roman came to be applied to tales written in thevarious vernaculars, especially in old French.
Now with what featuresof these tales were people most struck? The reply to this question isfound in a passage of a fifteenth-century Latin manuscript:17 “Fromthe reading of certain romantics, that is, books of poetry composed inFrench on military deeds which are for the most part fictitious.
18Here the term romantic is applied to books that we should stillcall romantic and for the very same reason, namely, because of thepredominance in these books of the element of fiction over reality.
In general a thing is romantic when, as Aristotle would say, it iswonderful rather than probable; in other words, when it violates thenormal sequence of cause and effect in favor of adventure.
Here isthe fundamental contrast between the words classic and romantic whichmeets us at the outset and in some form or other persists in all theuses of the word down to the present day.
A thing is romantic when itis strange, unexpected, intense, superlative, extreme, unique,19etc.
A thing is classical, on the other hand, when it is not unique,but representative of a class.
In this sense medical men may speakcorrectly of a classic case of typhoid fever, or a classic case ofhysteria.
One is even justified in speaking of a classic example ofromanticism.
By an easy extension of meaning a thing is classical whenit belongs to a high class or to the best class.
The type of romanticism referred to in the fifteenth-century manuscriptwas, it will be observed, the spontaneous product of the popularimagination of the Middle Ages.
We may go further and say that theuncultivated human imagination in all times and places is romantic inthe same way.
It hungers for the thrilling and the marvellous and is,in short, incurably melodramatic.
All students of the past know how,when the popular imagination is left free to work on actual historicalcharacters and events, it quickly introduces into these charactersand events the themes of universal folk-lore, and makes a ruthlesssacrifice of reality to the love of melodramatic surprise.
For example,the original nucleus of historical fact has almost disappeared in thelurid melodramatic tale “Les quatre fils Aymon,” which has continued,as presented in the “Bibliothèque Bleue,” to appeal to the Frenchpeasant down to our own times.
Those who look with alarm on recentattacks upon romanticism should therefore be comforted.
All children,nearly all women and the vast majority of men always have been, areand probably always will be romantic.
This is true even of a classicalperiod like the second half of the seventeenth century in France.
Boileau is supposed to have killed the vogue of the interminableromances of the early seventeenth century which themselves continuethe spirit of the mediæval romances.
But recent investigations haveshown that the vogue of these romances continued until well on into theeighteenth century.
They influenced the imagination of Rousseau, thegreat modern romancer.
But to return to the history of the word romantic.
The first printedexamples of the word in any modern tongue are, it would seem, to befound in English.
The Oxford Dictionary cites the following from F.
Greville’s “Life of Sidney” (written before 1628, published in 1652):“Doe not his Arcadian romantics live after him?”--meaning apparentlyideas or features suggestive of romance.
Of extreme interest is theuse of the word in Evelyn’s “Diary” (3 August, 1654): “Were Sir Guy’sgrot improved as it might be, it were capable of being made a mostromantic and pleasant place.
The word is not only used in a favorablesense, but it is applied to nature; and it is this use of the word inconnection with outer nature that French and German literatures aregoing to derive later from England.
Among the early English uses ofthe word romantic may be noted: “There happened this extraordinarycase--one of the most romantique that ever I heard in my life and couldnot have believed,”20 etc.
Most other authors that I ever readeither have wild romantic tales wherein they strain Love and Honor tothat ridiculous height that it becomes burlesque,”21 etc.
The wordbecomes fairly common by the year 1700 and thousands of examples couldbe collected from English writers in the eighteenth century.
Here aretwo early eighteenth-century instances:    “The gentleman I am married to made love to me in rapture but    it was the rapture of a Christian and a man of Honor, not a    romantic hero or a whining coxcomb.
22    Whether the charmer sinner it or saint it    If folly grow romantick I must paint it.
23The early French and German uses of the word romantic seem to derivefrom England.
One important point is to be noted as to France.
Beforeusing the word romantique the French used the word romanesque inthe sense of wild, unusual, adventurous--especially in matters ofsentiment, and they have continued to employ romanesque alongsideromantique, which is now practically used only of the romanticschool.
A great deal of confusion is thus avoided into which we fallin English from having only the one word romantic, which must do dutyfor both romantique and romanesque.
An example of romantiqueis found in French as early as 1675;24 but the word owed its voguepractically to the anglomania that set in about the middle of theeighteenth century.
The first very influential French example of theword is appropriately found in Rousseau in the Fifth Promenade (1777):“The shores of the Lake of Bienne are more wild and romantic than thoseof the Lake of Geneva.
The word romantique was fashionable in Franceespecially as applied to scenery from about the year 1785, but withoutany thought as yet of applying it to a literary school.
In Germany the word romantisch as an equivalent of the Frenchromanesque and modern German romanhaft, appears at the end ofthe seventeenth century and plainly as a borrowing from the French.
Heidigger, a Swiss, used it several times in his “Mythoscopiaromantica,”25 an attack on romances and the wild and vain imaginingsthey engender.
According to Heidigger the only resource againstromanticism in this sense is religion.
In Germany as in France theassociation of romantic with natural scenery comes from England,especially from the imitations and translations of Thomson’s “Seasons.
In the second half of the eighteenth century the increasingly favorableuse of words like Gothic and enthusiastic as well as the emergence ofwords like sentimental and picturesque are among the symptoms of a newmovement, and the fortunes of the word romantic were more or less boundup with this movement.
Still, apart from its application to naturalscenery, the word is as yet far from having acquired a favorableconnotation if we are to believe an essay by John Foster on the“Application of the Epithet Romantic” (1805).
Foster’s point of view isnot unlike that of Heidigger.
Romantic, he says, had come to be usedas a term of vague abuse, whereas it can be used rightly only of theascendancy of imagination over judgment, and is therefore synonymouswith such words as wild, visionary, extravagant.
A man possessingso strong a judgment and so subordinate a fancy as Dean Swift wouldhardly have been made romantic … if he had studied all the books in DonQuixote’s library.
It is not, Foster admits, a sign of high endowmentfor a youth to be too coldly judicial, too deaf to the blandishments ofimaginative illusion.
Yet in general a man should strive to bring hisimagination under the control of sound reason.
But how is it possiblethus to prevail against the deceits of fancy? Right knowing, he assertsvery un-Socratically, is not enough to ensure right doing.
At thispoint Foster changes from the tone of a literary essay to that of asermon, and, maintaining a thesis somewhat similar to that of Pascal inthe seventeenth century and Heidigger in the eighteenth, he concludesthat a man’s imagination will run away with his judgment or reasonunless he have the aid of divine grace.
IIWhen Foster wrote his essay there was no question as yet in Englandof a romantic school.
Before considering how the word came to beapplied to a particular movement we need first to bring out morefully certain broad conflicts of tendency during the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries, conflicts that are not sufficiently revealedby the occasional uses during this period of the word romantic.
Inthe contrast Foster established between judgment and imagination heis merely following a long series of neo-classical critics and thiscontrast not only seemed to him and these critics, but still seemsto many, the essential contrast between classicism and romanticism.
We shall be helped in understanding how judgment (or reason) andimagination came thus to be sharply contrasted if we consider brieflythe changes in the meaning of the word wit during the neo-classicalperiod, and also if we recollect that the contrast between judgment andimagination is closely related to the contrast the French are so fondof establishing between the general sense (le sens commun) and theprivate sense or sense of the individual (le sens propre).
In the sixteenth century prime emphasis was put not upon common sense,but upon wit or conceit or ingenuity (in the sense of quickness ofimagination).
The typical Elizabethan strove to excel less by judgmentthan by invention, by “high-flying liberty of conceit”; like Falstaffhe would have a brain “apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full ofnimble, fiery, and delectable shapes.
Wit at this time, it shouldbe remembered, was synonymous not only with imagination but withintellect (in opposition to will).
The result of the worship of wit inthis twofold sense was a sort of intellectual romanticism.
Though itsorigins are no doubt mediæval, it differs from the ordinary romanticismof the Middle Ages to which I have already referred in being thusconcerned with thought rather than with action.
Towards the end of theRenaissance and in the early seventeenth century especially, peoplewere ready to pursue the strange and surprising thought even at therisk of getting too far away from the workings of the normal mind.
Hence the “points” and “conceits” that spread, as Lowell put it, likea “cutaneous eruption” over the face of Europe; hence the Gongorists,and Cultists, the Marinists and Euphuists, the précieux and the“metaphysical” poets.
And then came the inevitable swing away from allthis fantasticality towards common sense.
A demand arose for somethingthat was less rare and “precious” and more representative.
This struggle between the general sense and the sense of the individualstands out with special clearness in France.
A model was graduallyworked out by aid of the classics, especially the Latin classics, asto what man should be.
Those who were in the main movement of the timeelaborated a great convention, that is they came together aboutcertain things.
They condemned in the name of their convention thosewho were too indulgent of their private sense, in other words, tooeccentric in their imaginings.
A Théophile, for example, fell intodisesteem for refusing to restrain his imagination, for asserting thetype of “spontaneity” that would have won him favor in any romanticperiod.
26The swing away from intellectual romanticism can also be traced inthe changes that took place in the meaning of the word wit in bothFrance and England.
One of the main tasks of the French critics of theseventeenth century and of English critics, largely under the lead ofthe French, was to distinguish between true and false wit.
The workthat would have been complimented a little earlier as “witty” and“conceited” is now censured as fantastic and far-fetched, as lacking injudicial control over the imagination, and therefore in general appeal.
The movement away from the sense of the individual towards common sensegoes on steadily from the time of Malherbe to that of Boileau.
Balzacattacks Ronsard for his individualistic excess, especially for hisaudacity in inventing words without reference to usage.
Balzac himselfis attacked by Boileau for his affectation, for his straining to saythings differently from other people.
In so far his wit was not truebut false.
La Bruyère, in substantial accord with Boileau, definesfalse wit as wit which is lacking in good sense and judgment and “inwhich the imagination has too large a share.
27What the metaphysical poets in England understood by wit, accordingto Dr.
Johnson, was the pursuit of their thoughts to their lastramifications, and in this pursuit of the singular and the novel theylost the “grandeur of generality.
This imaginative quest of rarityled to the same recoil as in France, to a demand for common sense andjudgment.
The opposite extreme from the metaphysical excess is reachedwhen the element of invention is eliminated entirely from wit and it isreduced, as it is by Pope, to rendering happily the general sense--    What oft was thought but ne’er so well expressed.
Dr.
Johnson says that the decisive change in the meaning of the wordwit took place about the time of Cowley.
Important evidences of thischange and also of the new tendency to depreciate the imaginationis also found in certain passages of Hobbes.
Hobbes identifies theimagination with the memory of outer images and so looks on it as“decaying sense.
28 “They who observe similitudes,” he remarkselsewhere, making a distinction that was to be developed by Locke andaccepted by Addison, “in case they be such as are but rarely observedby others are said to have a good wit; by which, in this occasion, ismeant a good fancy” (wit has here the older meaning).
But they whodistinguish and observe differences,” he continues, “are said to havea good judgment.
Fancy without the help of judgment is not worthy ofcommendation, whereas judgment is commended for itself without the helpof fancy.
Indeed without steadiness and direction to some end, a greatfancy is one kind of madness.
Judgment without fancy,” he concludes,“is wit” (this anticipates the extreme neo-classical use of the wordwit), “but fancy without judgment, not.
Dryden betrays the influence of Hobbes when he says of the period ofincubation of his “Rival Ladies”: “Fancy was yet in its first work,moving the sleeping images of things towards the light, there to bedistinguished and either chosen or rejected by judgment.
Fancy orimagination (the words were still synonymous), as conceived by theEnglish neo-classicists, often shows a strange vivacity for a facultythat is after all only “decaying sense.
Fancy without judgment,”says Dryden, “is a hot-mouthed jade without a curb.
Fancy,” writesRymer in a similar vein, “leaps and frisks, and away she’s gone; whilstreason rattles the chain and follows after.
The following lines ofMulgrave are typical of the neo-classical notion of the relationbetween fancy and judgment:    As all is dullness when the Fancy’s bad,    So without Judgment, Fancy is but mad.
Reason is that substantial, useful part    Which gains the Head, while t’ other wins the Heart.
29The opposition established by the neo-classicist in passages of thiskind is too mechanical.
Fancy and judgment do not seem to coöperatebut to war with one another.
In case of doubt the neo-classicist isalways ready to sacrifice fancy to the “substantial, useful part,”and so he seems too negative and cool and prosaic in his reason, andthis is because his reason is so largely a protest against a previousromantic excess.
What had been considered genius in the time of the“metaphysicals” had too often turned out to be only oddity.
With thiswarning before them men kept their eyes fixed very closely on themodel of normal human nature that had been set up, and imitated itvery literally and timorously.
A man was haunted by the fear that hemight be “monstrous,” and so, as Rymer put it, “satisfy nobody’s maggotbut his own.
Correctness thus became a sort of tyranny.
We suffer tothe present day from this neo-classical failure to work out a soundconception of the imagination in its relation to good sense.
Becausethe neo-classicist held the imagination lightly as compared withgood sense the romantic rebels, were led to hold good sense lightlyas compared with imagination.
The romantic view in short is too muchthe neo-classical view turned upside down; and, as Sainte-Beuve says,nothing resembles a hollow so much as a swelling.
IIIBecause the classicism against which romanticism rebelled wasinadequate it does not follow that every type of classicism suffersfrom a similar inadequacy.
The great movement away from imaginativeunrestraint towards regularity and good sense took place in the mainunder French auspices.
In general the French have been the chiefexponents of the classic spirit in modern times.
They themselves feelthis so strongly that a certain group in France has of late yearsinclined to use interchangeably the words classicist and nationalist.
But this is a grave confusion, for if the classic spirit is anythingat all it is in its essence not local and national, but universaland human.
To be sure, any particular manifestation of classicismwill of necessity contain elements that are less universal, elementsthat reflect merely a certain person or persons, or a certain age andcountry.
This is a truth that we scarcely need to have preached to us;for with the growth of the historical method we have come to fix ourattention almost exclusively on these local and relative elements.
Thecomplete critic will accept the historical method but be on his guardagainst its excess.
He will see an element in man that is set above thelocal and the relative; he will learn to detect this abiding elementthrough all the flux of circumstance; in Platonic language, he willperceive the One in the Many.
Formerly, it must be admitted, critics were not historical enough.
They took to be of the essence of classicism what was merely its localcoloring, especially the coloring it received from the French of theseventeenth century.
If we wish to distinguish between essence andaccident in the classic spirit we must get behind the French of theseventeenth century, behind the Italians of the sixteenth century wholaid the foundations of neo-classical theory, behind the Romans whowere the immediate models of most neo-classicists, to the source ofclassicism in Greece.
Even in Greece the classic spirit is very muchimplicated in the local and the relative, yet in the life of no otherpeople perhaps does what is universal in man shine forth more clearlyfrom what is only local and relative.
We still need, therefore, toreturn to Greece, not merely for the best practice, but for the besttheory of classicism; for this is still found in spite of all itsobscurities and incompleteness in the Poetics of Aristotle.
If we haverecourse to this treatise, however, it must be on condition that we donot, like the critics of the Renaissance, deal with it in an abstractand dogmatic way (the form of the treatise it must be confessed gavethem no slight encouragement), but in a spirit akin to Aristotle’s ownas revealed in the total body of his writings--a spirit that is at itsbest positive and experimental.
Aristotle not only deals positively and experimentally with the naturalorder and with man so far as he is a part of this order, but he dealsin a similar fashion with a side of man that the modern positivistoften overlooks.
Like all the great Greeks Aristotle recognizes thatman is the creature of two laws: he has an ordinary or natural selfof impulse and desire and a human self that is known practically as apower of control over impulse and desire.
If man is to become human hemust not let impulse and desire run wild, but must oppose to everythingexcessive in his ordinary self, whether in thought or deed or emotion,the law of measure.
This insistence on restraint and proportion isrightly taken to be of the essence not merely of the Greek spirit butof the classical spirit in general.
The norm or standard that is to setbounds to the ordinary self is got at by different types of classicistsin different ways and described variously: for example, as the humanlaw, or the better self, or reason (a word to be discussed more fullylater), or nature.
Thus when Boileau says, “Let nature be your onlystudy,” he does not mean outer nature, nor again the nature of this orthat individual, but representative human nature.
Having decided whatis normal either for man or some particular class of men the classicisttakes this normal “nature” for his model and proceeds to imitate it.
Whatever accords with the model he has thus set up he pronouncesnatural or probable, whatever on the other hand departs too far fromwhat he conceives to be the normal type or the normal sequence of causeand effect he holds to be “improbable” and unnatural or even, if itattains an extreme of abnormality, “monstrous.
Whatever in conductor character is duly restrained and proportionate with reference tothe model is said to observe decorum.
Probability and decorum areidentical in some of their aspects and closely related in all.
30To recapitulate, a general nature, a core of normal experience, isaffirmed by all classicists.
From this central affirmation derives thedoctrine of imitation, and from imitation in turn the doctrines ofprobability and decorum.
But though all classicists are alike in insisting on nature, imitation,probability and decorum, they differ widely, as I have alreadyintimated, in what they understand by these terms.
Let us considerfirst what Aristotle and the Greeks understand by them.
The first pointto observe is that according to Aristotle one is to get his generalnature not on authority or second hand, but is to disengage it directlyfor himself from the jumble of particulars that he has before his eyes.
He is not, says Aristotle, to imitate things as they are, but as theyought to be.
Thus conceived imitation is a creative act.
Through allthe welter of the actual one penetrates to the real and so succeedswithout ceasing to be individual in suggesting the universal.
Poetrythat is imitative in this sense is, according to Aristotle, more“serious” and “philosophical” than history.
History deals merely withwhat has happened, whereas poetry deals with what may happen accordingto probability or necessity.
Poetry, that is, does not portray lifeliterally but extricates the deeper or ideal truth from the flux ofcircumstance.
One may add with Sydney that if poetry is thus superiorto history in being more serious and philosophical it resembles historyand is superior to philosophy in being concrete.
The One that the great poet or artist perceives in the Many and thatgives to his work its high seriousness is not a fixed absolute.
Ingeneral the model that the highly serious man (ὁ σπουδαῖος) imitatesand that keeps his ordinary self within the bounds of decorum is notto be taken as anything finite, as anything that can be formulatedonce for all.
This point is important for on it hinges every rightdistinction not merely between the classic and the romantic, butbetween the classic and the pseudo-classic.
Romanticism has claimedfor itself a monopoly of imagination and infinitude, but on closerexamination, as I hope to show later, this claim, at least so far asgenuine classicism is concerned, will be found to be quite unjustified.
For the present it is enough to say that true classicism does notrest on the observance of rules or the imitation of models but on animmediate insight into the universal.
Aristotle is especially admirablein the account he gives of this insight and of the way it may manifestitself in art and literature.
One may be rightly imitative, he says,and so have access to a superior truth and give others access to itonly by being a master of illusion.
Though the great poet “breathesimmortal air,” though he sees behind the shows of sense a world ofmore abiding relationships, he can convey his vision not directly butonly imaginatively.
Aristotle, one should observe, does not establishany hard and fast opposition between judgment and imagination, anopposition that pervades not only the neo-classical movement but alsothe romantic revolt from it.
He simply affirms a supersensuous orderwhich one can perceive only with the help of fiction.
The best art,says Goethe in the true spirit of Aristotle, gives us the “illusionof a higher reality.
This has the advantage of being experimental.
It is merely a statement of what one feels in the presence of a greatpainting, let us say, or in reading a great poem.
IVAfter this attempt to define briefly with the help of the Greeks theclassical spirit in its essence we should be prepared to understandmore clearly the way in which this spirit was modified in neo-classicaltimes, especially in France.
The first thing that strikes one aboutthe classicism of this period is that it does not rest on immediateperception like that of the Greeks but on outer authority.
The merelydogmatic and traditional classicist gave a somewhat un-Greek meaningto the doctrines of nature and imitation.
Why imitate nature directly,said Scaliger, when we have in Virgil a second nature? Imitation thuscame to mean the imitation of certain outer models and the followingof rules based on these models.
Now it is well that one who aims atexcellence in any field should begin by a thorough assimilation of theachievements of his great predecessors in this field.
Unfortunatelythe neo-classical theorist tended to impose a multitude of preceptsthat were based on what was external rather than on what was vitalin the practice of his models.
In so far the lesson of form that thegreat ancients can always teach any one who approaches them in theright spirit degenerated into formalism.
This formalistic turn givento the doctrine of imitation was felt from the outset to be a menaceto originality; to be incompatible, and everything hinges at last onthis point, with the spontaneity of the imagination.
There was animportant reaction headed by men like Boileau, within the neo-classicalmovement itself, against the oppression of the intuitive side of humannature by mere dogma and authority, above all against the notion that“regularity” is in itself any guarantee of literary excellence.
Aschool of rules was succeeded by a school of taste.
Yet even to theend the neo-classicist was too prone to reject as unnatural or evenmonstrous everything that did not fit into one of the traditionalpigeon-holes.
One must grant, indeed, that much noble work was achievedunder the neo-classical dispensation, work that shows a genuine insightinto the universal, but it is none the less evident that the view ofthe imagination held during this period has a formalistic taint.
This taint in neo-classicism is due not merely to its dogmatic andmechanical way of dealing with the doctrine of imitation but also tothe fact that it had to reconcile classical with Christian dogma; andthe two antiquities, classical and Christian, if interpreted vitallyand in the spirit, were in many respects divergent and in some respectscontradictory.
The general outcome of the attempts at reconciliationmade by the literary casuists of Italy and France was that Christianityshould have a monopoly of truth and classicism a monopoly of fiction.
For the true classicist, it will be remembered, the two things areinseparable--he gets at his truth through a veil of fiction.
Many ofthe neo-classicists came to conceive of art as many romanticists wereto conceive of it later as a sort of irresponsible game or play, butthey were, it must be confessed, very inferior to the romanticistsin the spontaneity of their fiction.
They went for this fiction asfor everything else to the models, and this meant in practice thatthey employed the pagan myths, not as imaginative symbols of a higherreality--it is still possible to employ them in that way--but merely inBoileau’s phrase as “traditional ornaments” (ornements reçus).
Theneo-classicist to be sure might so employ his “fiction” as to inculcatea moral; in that case he is only too likely to give us instead ofthe living symbol, dead allegory; instead of high seriousness, itscaricature, didacticism.
The traditional stock of fiction became atlast so intolerably trite as to be rejected even by some of the lateneo-classicists.
The rejection and contempt of fiction,” said Dr.
Johnson (who indulged in it himself on occasion) “is rational andmanly.
But to reject fiction in the larger sense is to miss the truedriving power in human nature--the imagination.
Before concluding,however, that Dr.
Johnson had no notion of the rôle of the imaginationone should read his attack on the theory of the three unities31 whichwas later to be turned to account by the romanticists.
Now the three unities may be defended on an entirely legitimateground--on the ground namely that they make for concentration, a primevirtue in the drama; but the grounds on which they were actuallyimposed on the drama, especially in connection with the Quarrel ofthe Cid, illustrate the corruption of another main classical doctrine,that of probability or verisimilitude.
In his dealings with probabilityas in his dealings with imitation, the neo-classical formalist didnot allow sufficiently for the element of illusion.
What he requiredfrom the drama in the name of probability was not the “illusion of ahigher reality,” but strict logic or even literal deception.
He wasnot capable of a poetic faith, not willing to suspend his disbeliefon passing from the world of ordinary fact to the world of artisticcreation.
Goethe was thinking especially of the neo-classical Frenchwhen he said: “As for the French, they will always be arrested by theirreason.
They do not recognize that the imagination has its own lawswhich are and always must be problematic for the reason.
It was also largely under French influence that the doctrine ofdecorum, which touches probability at many points, was turned asidefrom its true meaning.
Decorum is in a way the peculiar doctrine of theclassicist, is in Milton’s phrase “the grand masterpiece to observe.
The doctrines of the universal and the imitation of the universal godeeper indeed than decorum, so much deeper that they are shared byclassicism with religion.
The man who aspires to live religiously mustno less than the humanist look to some model set above his ordinaryself and imitate it.
But though the classicist at his best meditates,he does not, like the seeker after religious perfection, see inmeditation an end in itself but rather a support for the mediatoryvirtues, the virtues of the man who would live to the best advantagein this world rather than renounce it; and these virtues may be saidto be summed up in decorum.
For the best type of Greek humanist,a Sophocles let us say, decorum was a vital and immediate thing.
But there enters into decorum even from the time of the AlexandrianGreeks, and still more into French neo-classical decorum, a markedelement of artificiality.
The all-roundness and fine symmetry, thepoise and dignity that come from working within the bounds of thehuman law, were taken to be the privilege not of man in general but ofa special social class.
Take for instance verbal decorum: the Frenchneo-classicists assumed that if the speech of poetry is to be noble andhighly serious it must coincide with the speech of the aristocracy.
AsNisard puts it, they confused nobility of language with the language ofthe nobility.
Decorum was thus more or less merged with etiquette, sothat the standards of the stage and of literature in general came tocoincide, as Rousseau complains, with those of the drawing-room.
Morethan anything else this narrowing of decorum marks the decline from theclassic to the pseudo-classic, from form to formalism.
While condemning pseudo-decorum one should remember that even aGreek would have seen something paradoxical in a poem like Goethe’s“Hermann und Dorothea” and its attempt to invest with epic grandeur theaffairs of villagers and peasants.
After all, dignity and elevationand especially the opportunity for important action, which is thepoint on which the classicist puts prime emphasis, are normallythough not invariably associated with a high rather than with a meansocial estate.
In general one should insist that the decorum workedout under French auspices was far from being merely artificial.
TheFrench gentleman (honnête homme) of the seventeenth century oftenshowed a moderation and freedom from over-emphasis, an exquisite tactand urbanity that did not fall too far short of his immediate model,Horace, and related him to the all-round man of the Greeks (καλὸςκἀγαθός).
To be sure an ascetic Christian like Pascal sees in decoruma disguise of one’s ordinary self rather than a real curb upon it, andfeels that the gap is not sufficiently wide between even the best typeof the man of the world and the mere worldling.
One needs, however, tobe very austere to disdain the art of living that has been fosteredby decorum from the Greeks down.
Something of this art of livingsurvives even in a Chesterfield, who falls far short of the best typeof French gentleman and reminds one very remotely indeed of a Pericles.
Chesterfield’s half-jesting definition of decorum as the art ofcombining the useful appearances of virtue with the solid satisfactionsof vice points the way to its ultimate corruption.
Talleyrand, whomarks perhaps this last stage, was defined by Napoleon as “a silkstocking filled with mud.
In some of its late exemplars decorum hadactually become, as Rousseau complains, the “mask of hypocrisy” and the“varnish of vice.
One should not however, like Rousseau and the romanticists, judge ofdecorum by what it degenerated into.
Every doctrine of genuine worth isdisciplinary and men in the mass do not desire discipline.
Most men,”says Aristotle, “would rather live in a disorderly than in a sobermanner.
But most men do not admit any such preference--that would becrude and inartistic.
They incline rather to substitute for the realityof discipline some art of going through the motions.
Every greatdoctrine is thus in constant peril of passing over into some hollowsemblance or even, it may be, into some mere caricature of itself.
Whenone wishes therefore to determine the nature of decorum one shouldthink of a Milton, let us say, and not of a Talleyrand or even of aChesterfield.
Milton imitated the models, like any other neo-classicist, but hisimitation was not, in Joubert’s phrase, that of one book by anotherbook, but of one soul by another soul.
His decorum is thereforeimaginative; and it is the privilege of the imagination to givethe sense of spaciousness and infinitude.
On the other hand, theunimaginative way in which many of the neo-classicists held theirmain tenets--nature, imitation, probability, decorum--narrowed undulythe scope of the human spirit and appeared to close the gates ofthe future.
Art and diligence have now done their best,” says Dr.
Johnson of the versification of Pope, “and what shall be added will bethe effort of tedious toil and needless curiosity.
Nothing is moreperilous than thus to seem to confine man in some pinfold; there issomething in him that refuses to acquiesce in any position as final;he is in Nietzsche’s phrase the being who must always surpass himself.
The attempt to oppose external and mechanical barriers to the freedomof the spirit will create in the long run an atmosphere of stuffinessand smugness, and nothing is more intolerable than smugness.
Men wereguillotined in the French Revolution, as Bagehot suggests, simplybecause either they or their ancestors had been smug.
Inert acceptanceof tradition and routine will be met sooner or later by the cry ofFaust: Hinaus ins Freie!Before considering the value of the method chosen by Rousseau andthe romanticists for breaking up the “tiresome old heavens” andescaping from smugness and stuffiness, one should note that the lackof originality and genius which they lamented in the eighteenthcentury--especially in that part of it known as the Enlightenment--wasnot due entirely to pseudo-classic formalism.
At least two other maincurrents entered into the Enlightenment: first the empirical andutilitarian current that goes back to Francis Bacon, and some wouldsay to Roger Bacon; and secondly the rationalistic current that goesback to Descartes.
English empiricism gained international vogue inthe philosophy of Locke, and Locke denies any supersensuous elementin human nature to which one may have access with the aid of theimagination or in any other way.
Locke’s method of precise naturalisticobservation is in itself legitimate; for man is plainly subject tothe natural law.
What is not truly empirical is to bring the wholeof human nature under this law.
One can do this only by piecing outprecise observation and experiment with dogmatic rationalism.
One sideof Locke may therefore be properly associated with the father of modernrationalists, Descartes.
The attempt of the rationalist to lock uplife in some set of formulæ produces in the imaginative man a feelingof oppression.
He gasps for light and air.
The very tracing of causeand effect and in general the use of the analytical faculties--andthis is to fly to the opposite extreme--came to be condemned by theromanticists as inimical to the imagination.
Not only do they makeendless attacks on Locke, but at times they assail even Newton forhaving mechanized life, though Newton’s comparison of himself to achild picking up pebbles on the seashore would seem to show that he hadexperienced “the feeling infinite.
The elaboration of science into a closed system with the aid of logicand pure mathematics is as a matter of fact to be associated withDescartes rather than with Newton.
Neither Newton nor Descartes, onescarcely needs add, wished to subject man entirely to the natural lawand the nexus of physical causes; they were not in short determinists.
Yet the superficial rationalism of the Enlightenment was in the mainof Cartesian origin.
This Cartesian influence ramifies in so manydirections and is related at so many points to the literary movement,and there has been so much confusion about this relationship, that weneed to pause here to make a few distinctions.
Perhaps what most strikes one in the philosophy of Descartes is itsfaith in logic and abstract reasoning and the closely allied processesof mathematical demonstration.
Anything that is not susceptible ofclear proof in this logical and almost mathematical sense is tobe rejected.
Now this Cartesian notion of clearness is fatal to atrue classicism.
The higher reality, the true classicist maintains,cannot be thus demonstrated; it can only be grasped, and then nevercompletely, through a veil of imaginative illusion.
Boileau is reportedto have said that Descartes had cut the throat of poetry; and thischarge is justified in so far as the Cartesian requires from poetrya merely logical clearness.
This conception of clearness was alsoa menace to the classicism of the seventeenth century which restedin the final analysis not on logic but on tradition.
This appearedvery clearly in the early phases of the quarrel between ancients andmoderns when literary Cartesians like Perrault and Fontenelle attackedclassical dogma in the name of reason.
In fact one may ask if anydoctrine has ever appeared so fatal to every form of tradition--notmerely literary but also religious and political--as Cartesianism.
The rationalist of the eighteenth century was for dismissing as“prejudice” everything that could not give a clear account of itselfin the Cartesian sense.
This riot of abstract reasoning (la raisonraisonnante) that prepared the way for the Revolution has beenidentified by Taine and others with the classic spirit.
A more viciousconfusion has seldom gained currency in criticism.
It is true thatthe French have mixed a great deal of logic with their conception ofthe classic spirit, but that is because they have mixed a great dealof logic with everything.
I have already mentioned their tendency tosubstitute a logical for an imaginative verisimilitude; and strenuouslylogical classicists may be found in France from Chapelain toBrunetière.
Yet the distinction that should keep us from confusing merelogic with the classic spirit was made by a Frenchman who was himselfviolently logical and also a great geometrician--Pascal.
One shouldkeep distinct, says Pascal, the esprit de géométrie and the espritde finesse.
The esprit de finesse is not, like the esprit degéométrie, abstract, but very concrete.
32 So far as a man possessesthe esprit de finesse he is enabled to judge correctly of theordinary facts of life and of the relationships between man and man.
But these judgments rest upon such a multitude of delicate perceptionsthat he is frequently unable to account for them logically.
It is tointuitive good sense and not to the esprit de géométrie that thegentleman (honnête homme) of the neo-classical period owed his finetact.
Pascal himself finally took a stand against reason as understoodboth by the Cartesian and by the man of the world.
Unaided reasonhe held is unable to prevail against the deceits of the imagination;it needs the support of intuition--an intuition that he identifieswith grace, thus making it inseparable from the most austere form ofChristianity.
The “heart,” he says, and this is the name he gives tointuition, “has reasons of which the reason knows nothing.
A Plato oran Aristotle would not have understood this divorce between reason andintuition.
33Pascal seems to get his insight only by flouting ordinary good sense.
He identifies this insight with a type of theological dogma of whichgood sense was determined to be rid; and so it tended to get rid ofthe insight along with the dogma.
Classical dogma also seemed at timesto be in opposition to the intuitive good sense of the man of theworld.
The man of the world therefore often inclined to assail boththe classical and the Christian tradition in the name of good sense,just as the Cartesian inclined to assail these traditions in the nameof abstract reason.
Perhaps the best exponent of anti-traditional goodsense in the seventeenth century was Molière.
He vindicated nature,and by nature he still meant in the main normal human nature, fromarbitrary constraints of every kind whether imposed by an asceticChristianity or by a narrow and pedantic classicism.
UnfortunatelyMolière is too much on the side of the opposition.
He does not seemto put his good sense into the service of some positive insight ofhis own.
Good sense may be of many degrees according to the order offacts of which it has a correct perception.
The order of facts in humannature that Molière’s good sense perceived is not the highest and sothis good sense appears at times too ready to justify the bourgeoisagainst the man who has less timid and conventional views.
So atleast Rousseau thought when he made his famous attack on Molière.
34Rousseau assailed Molière in the name of instinct as Pascal would haveassailed him in the name of insight, and fought sense with sensibility.
The hostility of Rousseau to Molière, according to M.
Faguet, is thatof a romantic Bohemian to a philistine of genius.
35 One hesitates tocall Molière a philistine, but one may at least grant M.
Faguet thatMolière’s good sense is not always sufficiently inspired.
I have been trying to build up a background that will make clearwhy the reason of the eighteenth century (whether we understandby reason logic or good sense) had come to be superficial andtherefore oppressive to the imagination.
It is only with referenceto this “reason” that one can understand the romantic revolt.
Butneo-classical reason itself can be understood only with reference toits background--as a recoil namely from a previous romantic excess.
This excess was manifested not only in the intellectual romanticism ofwhich I have already spoken, but in the cult of the romantic deed thathad flourished in the Middle Ages.
This cult and the literature thatreflected it continued to appeal, even to the cultivated, well on intothe neo-classical period.
It was therefore felt necessary to frame adefinition of reason that should be a rebuke to the extravagance andimprobability of the mediæval romances.
When men became consciousin the eighteenth century of the neo-classical meagerness on theimaginative side they began to look back with a certain envy to thefree efflorescence of fiction in the Middle Ages.
They began to askthemselves with Hurd whether the reason and correctness they had wonwere worth the sacrifice of a “world of fine fabling.
36 We must not,however, like Heine and many others, look on the romantic movement asmerely a return to the Middle Ages.
We have seen that the men of theMiddle Ages themselves understood by romance not simply their own kindof speech and writing in contrast with what was written in Latin, buta kind of writing in which the pursuit of strangeness and adventurepredominated.
This pursuit of strangeness and adventure will be foundto predominate in all types of romanticism.
The type of romanticism,however, which came in towards the end of the eighteenth centurydid not, even when professedly mediæval, simply revert to the oldertypes.
It was primarily not a romanticism of thought or of action,the types we have encountered thus far, but a romanticism of feeling.
The beginnings of this emotional romanticism antedate considerablythe application of the word romantic to a particular literary school.
Before considering how the word came to be thus applied we shall needto take a glance at eighteenth-century sentimentalism, especially atthe plea for genius and originality that, from about the middle of thecentury on, were opposed to the tameness and servile imitation of theneo-classicists.
CHAPTER IIROMANTIC GENIUSRomanticism, it has been remarked, is all that is not Voltaire.
Theclash between Rousseau and Voltaire is indeed not merely the clashbetween two men, it is the clash between two incompatible views oflife.
Voltaire is the end of the old world, as Goethe has put it,Rousseau the beginning of the new.
One is not to suppose, however, that Voltaire was a consistent championof the past.
He is indeed with all his superficial clearness one of themost incoherent of writers.
At the same time that he defended classicaltradition he attacked Christian tradition, spreading abroad a spirit ofmockery and irreverence that tended to make every traditional beliefimpossible.
The “reason” to which he appeals has all the shallownessthat I have noticed in the “reason” of the eighteenth century.
Thoughhe does not fall into the Cartesian excess of abstract reasoning, andthough the good sense that he most often understands by reason isadmirably shrewd within certain bounds, he nevertheless falls veryfar short of the standards of a true classicism.
He delights in thephilosophy of Locke and has little sense for Greek philosophy or forthe higher aspects of Greek literature.
He is quite lacking in thequality of imagination that is needful if one is to communicate withwhat is above the ordinary rational level.
So far from being capable ofhigh seriousness, he is scarcely capable of ordinary seriousness.
Andso the nobility, elegance, imitation, and decorum that he is constantlypreaching have about them a taint of formalism.
Perhaps this taintappears most conspicuously in his conception of decorum.
A man may bewilling to impose restrictions on his ordinary self--and every type ofdecorum is restrictive--if he is asked to do so for some adequate end.
The end of the decorum that an Aristotle, for example, would impose isthat one may become more human and therefore, as he endeavors to showin a highly positive fashion, happier.
The only art and literature thatwill please a man who has thus become human through the observance oftrue decorum is an art and literature that are themselves human anddecorous.
Voltaire for his part wishes to subject art and literatureto an elaborate set of restrictions in the name of decorum, but theserestrictions are not joined to any adequate end.
The only reward heholds out to those who observe all these restrictions is “the meritof difficulty overcome.
At bottom, like so many of the Jesuits fromwhom he received his education, he looks upon art as a game--a veryingenious and complicated game.
The French muse he compares to aperson executing a difficult clog dance on a tight rope, and he arguesfrom this comparison, not that the French muse should assume a lessconstrained posture, but that she should on the contrary be exemplaryto the nations.
No wonder the romanticists and even Dr.
Johnsondemurred at Voltaire’s condemnation of Shakespeare in the name of thistype of decorum.
Voltaire is therefore, in spite of all his dazzling gifts, one ofthe most compromising advocates of classicism.
Pope also had eminentmerits, but from the truly classical point of view he is about asinadequate as Voltaire; and this is important to remember becauseEnglish romanticism tends to be all that is not Pope.
The Englishromanticists revolted especially from the poetic diction of which Popewas one of the chief sources, and poetic diction, with its failureto distinguish between nobility of language and the language of thenobility, is only an aspect of artificial decorum.
However, the revoltfrom poetic diction and decorum in general is not the central aspect ofthe great movement that resulted in the eclipse of the wit and man ofthe world and in the emergence of the original genius.
What the geniuswanted was spontaneity, and spontaneity, as he understood it, involvesa denial, not merely of decorum, but of something that, as I have said,goes deeper than decorum--namely the doctrine of imitation.
Accordingto Voltaire genius is only judicious imitation.
According to Rousseauthe prime mark of genius is refusal to imitate.
The movement away fromimitation, however, had already got well started before it thus cameto a picturesque head in the clash between Rousseau and Voltaire, andif we wish to understand this movement we need to take a glance at itsbeginnings--especially in England.
There are reasons why this supposed opposition between imitation andgenius should have been felt in England more keenly than elsewhere.
Thedoctrine of imitation in its neo-classical form did not get establishedthere until about the time of Dryden.
In the meanwhile England had hada great creative literature in which the freedom and spontaneity of theimagination had not been cramped by a too strict imitation of models.
Dryden himself, though he was doing more than any one else to promotethe new correctness that was coming in from France, felt that thiscorrectness was no equivalent for the Elizabethan inspiration.
Thestructure that he and his contemporaries were erecting might be moreregular, but lacked the boldness and originality of that reared by the“giant race before the flood”:    Our age was cultivated thus at length;    But what we gained in skill we lost in strength.
Our builders were with want of genius cursed;    The second temple was not like the first.
37This contrast between the imitator and the inspired original wasdeveloped by Addison in a paper (“Spectator,” 160) that was destinedto be used against the very school to which he himself belonged.
For Addison was in his general outlook a somewhat tame Augustan.
Nevertheless he exalts the “natural geniuses” who have something“nobly wild and extravagant” in them above the geniuses who have been“refined by conversation, reflection and the reading of the most politeauthors”; who have “formed themselves by rules and submitted thegreatness of their natural talents to the corrections and restraints ofart.
The great danger in these latter kind of geniuses, is lest theycramp their own abilities too much by imitation, and form themselvesaltogether upon models, without giving full play to their own naturalparts.
An imitation of the best authors is not to compare with a goodoriginal; and I believe we may observe that very few writers make anextraordinary figure in the world, who have not something in their wayof thinking or expressing themselves that is peculiar to them, andentirely their own.
Another main influence that was making against the doctrine ofimitation was also largely of English origin.
This was the idea ofprogress through scientific observation and experiment.
As a resultof this type of positivism, discovery was being added to discovery.
Science was kindling man’s imagination and opening up before him whathe really craves, the vista of an endless advance.
Why should notliterature likewise do something new and original instead of stickingforever in the same rut of imitation? In its Greek form the doctrineof imitation was, as I have tried to show, not only flexible andprogressive, but in its own way, positive and experimental.
But inmodern times the two main forms of imitation, the classical and theChristian, have worked within the limits imposed by tradition andtraditional models.
The imitation of models, the Christian imitationof Christ, let us say, or the classical imitation of Horace, mayindeed be a very vital thing, the imitation of one soul by anothersoul; but when carried out in this vital way, the two main forms ofimitation tend to clash, and the compromise between them, as I havealready said, resulted in a good deal of formalism.
By its positiveand critical method science was undermining every traditional belief.
Both the Christian and the classical formalists would have been thefirst to deny that the truths of imitation for which they stood couldbe divorced from tradition and likewise put on a positive and criticalbasis.
The fact is indubitable in any case that the discrediting oftradition has resulted in a progressive lapse from the religious andthe humanistic to the naturalistic level.
An equally indubitable factis that scientific or rationalistic naturalism tended from the earlyeighteenth century to produce emotional naturalism, and that both formsof naturalism were hostile to the doctrine of imitation.
The trend away from the doctrine of imitation towards emotionalnaturalism finds revolutionary expression in the literary field in sucha work as Young’s “Conjectures on Original Composition” (1759).
Addisonhad asserted, as we have seen, the superiority of what is original ina man, of what comes to him spontaneously, over what he acquires byconscious effort and culture.
Young, a personal friend of Addison’s,develops this contrast between the “natural” and the “artificial” toits extreme consequences.
Modern writers,” he says, “have a choiceto make.
They may soar in the regions of liberty, or move in thesoft fetters of easy imitation.
An original may be said to be of avegetable nature; it rises spontaneously from the vital root of genius;it grows, it is not made; imitations are often a sort of manufacture,wrought up by those mechanics, art and labor, out of preëxistentmaterials not their own.
We may as well grow good by another’svirtue, or fat by another’s food, as famous by another’s thought.
One evidence that we are still living in the movement of which Youngis one of the initiators is that his treatise will not only seem tomost of us a very spirited piece of writing--that it certainly is--butdoctrinally sound.
And yet it is only one of those documents veryfrequent in literary history which lack intrinsic soundness, but whichcan be explained if not justified as a recoil from an opposite extreme.
The unsoundness of Young’s work comes out clearly if one comparesit with the treatise on the “Sublime” attributed to Longinus whichis not a mere protest against a previous excess, but a permanentlyacceptable treatment of the same problem of genius and inspiration.
Longinus exalts genius, but is at the same time regardful of cultureand tradition, and even emphasizes the relation between inspiration andthe imitation of models.
Young insinuates, on the contrary, that oneis aided in becoming a genius by being brainless and ignorant.
Someare pupils of nature only, nor go further to school.
Many a geniusprobably there has been which could neither write nor read.
It followsalmost inevitably from these premises that genius flourishes most inthe primitive ages of society before originality has been crushedbeneath the superincumbent weight of culture and critics have beguntheir pernicious activities.
Young did not take this step himself, butit was promptly taken by others on the publication of the Ossianicpoems (1762).
Ossian is at once added to the list of great originalsalready enumerated by Addison--Homer, Pindar, the patriarchs of theOld Testament and Shakespeare (whom Young like the later romanticistsopposes to Pope).
Poetry,” says Diderot, summing up a whole movement,“calls for something enormous, barbaric and savage.
This exaltation of the virtues of the primitive ages is simplythe projection into a mythical past of a need that the man of theeighteenth century feels in the present--the need to let himselfgo.
This is what he understands by his “return to nature.
A wholerevolution is implied in this reinterpretation of the word nature.
To follow nature in the classical sense is to imitate what is normaland representative in man and so to become decorous.
To be natural inthe new sense one must begin by getting rid of imitation and decorum.
Moreover, for the classicist, nature and reason are synonymous.
Theprimitivist, on the other hand, means by nature the spontaneous playof impulse and temperament, and inasmuch as this liberty is hinderedrather than helped by reason, he inclines to look on reason, not as theequivalent but as the opposite of nature.
If one is to understand this development, one should note carefullyhow certain uses of the word reason, not merely by the neo-classicistsbut by the anti-traditionalists, especially in religion, tended toproduce this denial of reason.
It is a curious fact that some of thosewho were attacking the Christian religion in the name of reason, werethemselves aware that mere reason, whether one understood by the wordabstract reasoning or uninspired good sense, does not satisfy, thatin the long run man is driven either to rise higher or to sink lowerthan reason.
St.
Evremond, for example, prays nature to deliver manfrom the doubtful middle state in which she has placed him--eitherto “lift him up to angelic radiance,” or else to “sink him to theinstinct of simple animals.
38 Since the ascending path, the paththat led to angelic radiance, seemed to involve the acceptance ofa mass of obsolete dogma, man gradually inclined to sink below therational level and to seek to recover the “instinct of simple animals.
Another and still more fundamental fact that some of the rationalistsperceived and that militated against their own position, is that thedominant element in man is not reason, but imagination, or if oneprefers, the element of illusion.
Illusion,” said Voltaire himself,“is the queen of the human heart.
The great achievement of traditionat its best was to be at once a limit and a support to both reasonand imagination and so to unite them in a common allegiance.
In thenew movement, at the same time that reason was being encouraged byscientific method to rise up in revolt against tradition, imaginationwas being fascinated and drawn to the naturalistic level by scientificdiscovery and the vista of an endless advance that it opened up.
A mainproblem, therefore, for the student of this movement is to determinewhat forms of imaginative activity are possible on the naturalisticlevel.
A sort of understanding was reached on this point by differenttypes of naturalists in the course of the eighteenth century.
Oneform of imagination, it was agreed, should be displayed in science,another form in art and literature.
39 The scientific imaginationshould be controlled by judgment and work in strict subordination tothe facts.
In art and literature, on the other hand, the imaginationshould be free.
Genius and originality are indeed in strict ratio tothis freedom.
In the fairy land of fancy,” says Young, “genius maywander wild; there it has a creative power, and may reign arbitrarilyover its own empire of chimeras.
The empire of chimeras was later tobecome the tower of ivory.
This sheer indiscipline of the literaryimagination might seem in contrast with the discipline of thescientific imagination an inferiority; but such was not the view of thepartisans of original genius.
Kant, indeed, who was strongly influencedin his “Critique of Æsthetic Judgment” by these English theorists,40inclined to deny genius to the man of science for the very reason thathis imagination is so strictly controlled.
The fact would seem to bethat a great scientist, a Newton let us say, has as much right to beaccounted a genius as Shakespeare.
The inferiority of the genius of aNewton compared with that of a Shakespeare lies in a certain coldness.
Scientific genius is thus cold because it operates in a region lessrelevant to man than poetic genius; it is, in Bagehot’s phrase, moreremote from the “hearth of the soul.
The scientific and the literary imagination are indeed not quite sosharply contrasted by most of the theorists as might be inferredfrom what I have said; most of them do not admit that the literaryimagination should be entirely free to wander in its own “empire ofchimeras.
Even literary imagination, they maintain, should in somemeasure be under the surveillance of judgment or taste.
One shouldobserve, however, that the judgment or taste that is supposed tocontrol or restrict genius is not associated with the imagination.
On the contrary, imagination is associated entirely with the elementof novelty in things, which means, in the literary domain, with theexpansive eagerness of a man to get his own uniqueness uttered.
Thegenius for the Greek, let us remind ourselves, was not the man who wasin this sense unique, but the man who perceived the universal; and asthe universal can be perceived only with the aid of the imagination,it follows that genius may be defined as imaginative perception of theuniversal.
The universal thus conceived not only gives a centre andpurpose to the activity of the imagination, but sets bounds to the freeexpansion of temperament and impulse, to what came to be known in theeighteenth century as nature.
Kant, who denies genius to the man of science on grounds I have alreadymentioned, is unable to associate genius in art or literature with thisstrict discipline of the imagination to a purpose.
The imaginationmust be free and must, he holds, show this freedom not by workingbut by playing.
At the same time Kant had the cool temper of a manof the Enlightenment, and looked with the utmost disapproval on theaberrations that had marked in Germany the age of original genius (dieGeniezeit).
He was not in the new sense of the word nor indeed in anysense, an enthusiast.
And so he wished the reason, or judgment, tokeep control over the imagination without disturbing its free play;art is to have a purpose which is at the same time not a purpose.
Thedistinctions by which he works out the supposed relationship betweenjudgment and imagination are at once difficult and unreal.
One canindeed put one’s finger here more readily perhaps than elsewhere on thecentral impotence of the whole Kantian system.
Once discredit traditionand outer authority and then set up as a substitute a reason that isdivorced from the imagination and so lacks the support of supersensuousinsight, and reason will prove unable to maintain its hegemony.
Whenthe imagination has ceased to pull in accord with the reason in theservice of a reality that is set above them both, it is sure to becomethe accomplice of expansive impulse, and mere reason is not strongenough to prevail over this union of imagination and desire.
Reasonneeds some driving power behind it, a driving power that, when workingin alliance with the imagination, it gets from insight.
To supposethat man will long rest content with mere naked reason as his guideis to forget that “illusion is the queen of the human heart”; it isto revive the stoical error.
Schiller, himself a Kantian, felt thisrationalistic rigor and coldness of his master, and so sought, whileretaining the play theory of art, to put behind the cold reason ofKant the driving power it lacked; for this driving power he looked notto a supersensuous reality, not to insight in short, but to emotion.
He takes appropriately the motto for his “Æsthetic Letters” fromRousseau: Si c’est la raison qui fait l’homme, c’est le sentiment quile conduit.
He retains Kant’s play theory of art without even so muchoffset to this play as is implied in Kant’s “purposiveness withoutpurpose.
The nobility of Schiller’s intentions is beyond question.
At the same time, by encouraging the notion that it is possible toescape from neo-classical didacticism only by eliminating masculinepurpose from art, he opens the way for the worst perversions of theæsthete, above all for the divorce of art from ethical reality.
In art,according to Schiller, both imagination and feeling should be free andspontaneous, and the result of all this freedom, as he sees it, will beperfectly “ideal.
His suspicion of a purpose is invincible.
As soon asanything has a purpose it ceases to be æsthetic and in the same measuresuffers a loss of dignity.
Thus the æsthetic moment of the lion, hesays, is when he roars not with any definite design, but out of sheerlustiness, and for the pure pleasure of roaring.
One may assume safely the æsthetic attitude, or what amounts to thesame thing, allow one’s self to be guided by feeling, only on theassumption that feeling is worthy of trust.
As appears in the verymotto he took for his “Æsthetic Letters” Schiller was helped to thisfaith in man’s native goodness by Rousseau.
We need to pause for amoment at this point and consider the background of this belief whichfinds not only in Schiller but in Rousseau himself, with whom it isusually associated, a rather late expression.
The movement that tookits rise in the eighteenth century involves, we should recollect, abreak not with one but with two traditions--the classical and theChristian.
If the plea for genius and originality is to be largelyexplained as a protest against the mechanical imitation and artificialdecorum of a certain type of classicist, the assertion of man’s naturalgoodness is to be understood rather as a rebound from the doctrine oftotal depravity that was held by the more austere type of Christian.
This doctrine had even in the early centuries of the faith awakenedcertain protests like that of Pelagius, but for an understanding ofthe Rousseauistic protest one does not need to go behind the greatdeistic movement of the early eighteenth century.
God, instead ofbeing opposed to nature, is conceived by the deist as a power thatexpresses his goodness and loveliness through nature.
The oppressiveweight of fear that the older theology had laid upon the human spiritis thus gradually lifted.
Man begins to discover harmonies insteadof discords in himself and outer nature.
He not only sees virtuein instinct but inclines to turn virtue itself into a “sense,” orinstinct.
And this means in practice to put emotional expansion in theplace of spiritual concentration at the basis of life and morals.
Instudying this drift towards an æsthetic or sentimental morality onemay most conveniently take one’s point of departure in certain Englishwriters of deistic tendency, especially in Shaftesbury and his discipleHutcheson.
Considered purely as an initiator, Shaftesbury is probablymore important than Rousseau.
His influence ramifies out in everydirection, notably into Germany.
The central achievement of Shaftesbury from a purely psychologicalpoint of view may be said to be his transformation of conscience froman inner check into an expansive emotion.
He is thus enabled to setup an æsthetic substitute not merely for traditional religion but fortraditional humanism.
He undermines insidiously decorum, the centraldoctrine of the classicist, at the very time that he seems to bedefending it.
For decorum also implies a control upon the expansiveinstincts of human nature, and Shaftesbury is actually engaged inrehabilitating “nature,” and insinuating that it does not need anycontrol.
He attains this expansiveness by putting æsthetic in theplace of spiritual perception, and so merging more or less completelythe good and the true with the beautiful.
He thus points the way verydirectly to Rousseau’s rejection of both inner and outer controlin the name of man’s natural goodness.
Once accept Shaftesbury’stransformation of conscience and one is led almost inevitably to lookon everything that is expansive as natural or vital and on everythingthat restricts expansion as conventional or artificial.
Villers wroteto Madame de Staël (4 May, 1803): “The fundamental and creative ideaof all your work has been to show primitive, incorruptible, naïve,passionate nature in conflict with the barriers and shackles ofconventional life.
Note that this is also the guiding idea of theauthor of ‘Werther.
This contrast between nature and convention isindeed almost the whole of Rousseauism.
In permitting his expansiveimpulses to be disciplined by either humanism or religion man hasfallen away from nature much as in the old theology he has fallenaway from God, and the famous “return to nature” means in practicethe emancipation of the ordinary or temperamental self that had beenthus artificially controlled.
This throwing off of the yoke of bothChristian and classical discipline in the name of temperament is theessential aspect of the movement in favor of original genius.
Thegenius does not look to any pattern that is set above his ordinaryspontaneous ego and imitate it.
On the contrary, he attains to theself-expression that other men, intimidated by convention, weaklyforego.
In thus taking a stand for self-expression, the original genius is ina sense on firm ground--at least so far as the mere rationalist orthe late and degenerate classicist is concerned.
No conventions arefinal, no rules can set arbitrary limits to creation.
Reality cannot belocked up in any set of formulæ.
The element of change and novelty inthings, as the romanticists are never tired of repeating, is at oncevital and inexhaustible.
Wherever we turn, we encounter, as a romanticauthority, Jacob Boehme, declares, “abysmal, unsearchable and infinitemultiplicity.
Perhaps not since the beginning of the world have twomen or indeed two leaves or two blades of grass been exactly alike.
Out of a thousand men shaving, as Dr.
Johnson himself remarked, notwo will shave in just the same way.
A person carries his uniquenesseven into his thumbprint--as a certain class in the community haslearned to its cost.
But though all things are ineffably differentthey are at the same time ineffably alike.
And this oneness in thingsis, no less than the otherwiseness, a matter of immediate perception.
This universal implication of the one in the many is found even moremarked than elsewhere in the heart of the individual.
Each man hashis idiosyncrasy (literally his “private mixture”).
But in additionto his complexion, his temperamental or private self, every man hasa self that he possesses in common with other men.
Even the man whois most filled with his own uniqueness, or “genius,” a Rousseau, forexample, assumes this universal self in every word he utters.
Jovenods to Jove behind us as we talk.
The word character, one may note,is ambiguous, inasmuch as it may refer either to the idiosyncratic orto the universal human element in a man’s dual nature.
For example, anoriginal genius like William Blake not only uses the word characterin a different sense from Aristotle--he cannot even understand theAristotelian usage.
Aristotle,” he complains, “says characters areeither good or bad; now Goodness or Badness has nothing to do withCharacter.
An apple tree, a pear tree, a horse, a lion are Characters;but a good apple tree or a bad is an apple tree still, etc.
Butcharacter as Aristotle uses the word implies something that manpossesses and that a horse or tree does not possess--the power namelyto deliberate and choose.
A man has a good or bad character, he isethical or unethical, as one may say from the Greek word for characterin this sense (ἦθος), according to the quality of his choice as itappears in what he actually does.
This distinction between a man’sprivate, peculiar character (χαρακτήρ) and the character he possesseswhen judged with reference to something more general than his owncomplexion is very similar to the French distinction between the senspropre and the sens commun.
The general sense or norm that is opposed to mere temperament andimpulse may rest upon the ethos of a particular time and country--thetraditional habits and customs that the Rousseauist is wont to dismissas “artificial”--or it may rest in varying degrees upon immediateperception.
For example, the Ismene and Antigone of Sophocles areboth ethical; but Ismene would abide by the law of the state, whereasAntigone opposes to this law something still more universal--the“unwritten laws of heaven.
This insight of Antigone into a moral orderthat is set not only above her ordinary self but above the conventionof her time and country is something very immediate, somethingachieved, as I shall try to show more fully later, with the aid of theimagination.
It is scarcely necessary to add that such a perfect example of theethical imagination as one finds in Antigone--the imagination thatworks concentric with the human law--is rare.
In actual life forone Antigone who obeys the “unwritten laws of heaven” there willbe a thousand Ismenes who will be guided in their moral choices bythe law of the community.
This law, the convention of a particularplace and time, is always but a very imperfect image, a mere shadowindeed of the unwritten law which being above the ordinary rationallevel is, in a sense to be explained later, infinite and incapableof final formulation.
And yet men are forced if only on practicalgrounds to work out some approximation to this law as a barrier to theunchained appetites of the individual.
The elements that enter intoany particular attempt to circumscribe the individual in the interestsof the community are very mixed and in no small measure relative.
Yetthe things that any group of men have come together about--theirconventions in the literal meaning of the word--even the tabus of asavage tribe, are sure to reflect, however inadequately, the elementof oneness in man, the element which is opposed to expansive impulse,and which is no less real, no less a matter of immediate experience,than the element of irreducible difference.
The general sense thereforeshould never be sacrificed lightly to the sense of the individual.
Tabu, however inferior it may be to insight, deserves to rank higherafter all than mere temperament.
41The original genius proceeds upon the opposite assumption.
Everythingthat limits temperamental expansion is dismissed as either artificialor mechanical; everything on the contrary that makes for theemancipation of temperament, and so for variety and difference, hewelcomes as vital, dynamic, creative.
Now, speaking not metaphysicallybut practically and experimentally, man may, as I have said, follow twomain paths: he may develop his ethical self--the self that lays holdof unity--or he may put his main emphasis on the element within himand without him that is associated with novelty and change.
In directproportion as he turns his attention to the infinite manifoldness ofthings he experiences wonder; if on the other hand he attends to theunity that underlies the manifoldness and that likewise transcends him,he experiences awe.
As a man grows religious, awe comes more and moreto take the place in him of wonder.
The humanist is less averse fromthe natural order and its perpetual gushing forth of novelties than theman who is religious, yet even the humanist refuses to put his finalemphasis on wonder (his motto is rather nil admirari).
To illustrateconcretely, Dr.
Johnson can scarcely conceal his disdain for thewonderful, but being a genuinely religious spirit, is very capable ofawe.
Commenting on Yalden’s line    Awhile th’ Almighty wondering stood,Dr.
Johnson remarks: “He ought to have remembered that InfiniteKnowledge can never wonder.
All wonder is the effect of novelty uponIgnorance.
Granted the justness of the remark, Johnson seems inclinedat times to forget how wide is the gap in this respect between usand the Almighty and therefore to be unduly hostile to the elementof wonder.
To take the opposite case, it is not easy to discover ineither the personality or writings of Poe an atom of awe or reverence.
On the other hand he both experiences wonder and seeks in his artto be a pure wondersmith.
It is especially important to determine aman’s attitude towards himself in this matter of awe and wonder, inother words to determine whether he is taken up first of all with thatelement in his own nature which makes him incomprehensibly like othermen or with that element which makes him incomprehensibly differentfrom them.
A man, the wise have always insisted, should look withreverence but not with wonder on himself.
Rousseau boasts that if notbetter than other men, he is at least different.
By this gloatingsense of his own otherwiseness he may be said to have set the tone fora whole epoch.
Chateaubriand, for instance, is quite overcome by hisown uniqueness and wonderfulness.
At the most ordinary happenings heexclaims, as Sainte-Beuve points out, that such things happen only tohim.
Hugo again is positively stupefied at the immensity of his owngenius.
The theatricality that one feels in so much of the art of thisperiod arises from the eagerness of the genius to communicate to otherssomething of the amazement that he feels at himself.
René’s firstconcern is to inspire wonder even in the women who love him.
Célutafelt that she was going to fall upon the bosom of this man as one fallsinto an abyss.
In thus putting such an exclusive emphasis on wonder the Rousseauisticmovement takes on a regressive character.
For if life begins inwonder it culminates in awe.
To put “the budding rose above the rosefull-blown” may do very well for a mood, but as an habitual attitudeit implies that one is more interested in origins than in ends; andthis means in practice to look backward and downward instead of forwardand up.
The conscious analysis that is needed if one is to establishorderly sequences and relationships and so work out a kingdom of endsis repudiated by the Rousseauist because it diminishes wonder, becauseit interferes with the creative impulse of genius as it gushes upspontaneously from the depths of the unconscious.
The whole movement isfilled with the praise of ignorance and of those who still enjoy itsinappreciable advantages--the savage, the peasant and above all thechild.
The Rousseauist may indeed be said to have discovered the poetryof childhood of which only traces can be found in the past, but at whatwould seem at times a rather heavy sacrifice of rationality.
Ratherthan consent to have the bloom taken off things by analysis one should,as Coleridge tells us, sink back to the devout state of childlikewonder.
However, to grow ethically is not to sink back but to strugglepainfully forward.
To affirm the contrary is to set up the things thatare below the ordinary rational level as a substitute for the thingsthat are above it, and at the same time to proclaim one’s inability tomature.
The romanticist, it is true, is wont to oppose to the demandfor maturity Christ’s praise of the child.
But Christ evidently praisesthe child not because of his capacity for wonder but because of hisfreedom from sin, and it is of the essence of Rousseauism to deny thevery existence of sin--at least in the Christian sense of the word.
One may also read in the New Testament that when one has ceased to bea child one should give up childish things, and this is a saying thatno primitivist, so far as I am aware, has ever quoted.
On the contrary,he is ready to assert that what comes to the child spontaneously issuperior to the deliberate moral effort of the mature man.
The speechesof all the sages are, according to Maeterlinck, outweighed by theunconscious wisdom of the passing child.
Wordsworth hails a child ofsix as “Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!” (It is only fair to Coleridgeto say that he refused to follow Wordsworth into this final abyss ofabsurdity.
42) In much the same way Hugo pushes his adoration ofthe child to the verge of what has been termed “solemn silliness”(niaiserie solennelle).
To set up the spontaneity of the child as a substitute for insight,to identify wonder with awe, romance with religion, is to confuse thevery planes of being.
There would appear to be a confusion of this kindin what Carlyle takes to be his own chief discovery, in his “naturalsupernaturalism.
43 The natural order we must grant Carlyle isunfathomable, but it is not therefore awful, only wonderful.
A movementof charity belongs as Pascal says to an entirely different order.
44The spiritual order to which Pascal refers lifts a man so far as heperceives it out of his ordinary self and draws him to an ethicalcentre.
But the Rousseauist tends, as I have said, to repudiatethe very idea of an ethical centre along with the special forms inwhich it had got itself embedded.
Every attempt, whether humanisticor religious, to set up some such centre, to oppose a unifying andcentralizing principle to expansive impulse, seems to him arbitraryand artificial.
He does not discriminate between the ethical norm orcentre that a Sophocles grasps intuitively and the centrality that thepseudo-classicist hopes to achieve by mechanical imitation.
He arguesfrom his underlying assumption that the principle of variation is alonevital, that one’s genius and originality are in pretty direct ratioto one’s eccentricity in the literal meaning of the word; and he istherefore ready to affirm his singularity or difference in the face ofwhatever happens to be established.
This attitude, it is worth noting,is quite unlike that of the humorist in the old English sense of theword, who indulges his bent and is at the same time quite unconcernedwith any central model that he should imitate and with reference towhich he should discipline his oddities.
The idiosyncrasy of theRousseauist is not, like that of the humorist, genial, but defiant.
He is strangely self-conscious in his return to the unconscious.
Ineverything, from his vocabulary to the details of his dress, he iseager to emphasize his departure from the norm.
Hence the persistentpose and theatricality in so many of the leaders of this movement, inRousseau himself, for instance, or in Chateaubriand and Byron.
As forthe lesser figures in the movement their “genius” is often chieflydisplayed in their devices for calling attention to themselves as thelatest and most marvellous births of time; it is only one aspect inshort of an art in which the past century, whatever its achievement inthe other arts, has easily surpassed all its predecessors--the art ofadvertising.
One needs always to return, however, if one is to understand theromantic notion of genius, to a consideration of the pseudo-classicdecorum against which it is a protest.
The gentleman or man of theworld (honnête homme) was not, like the original genius, anxiousto advertise himself, to call attention to his own special noteof originality, since his primary concern was with an entirelydifferent problem, with the problem, namely, not of expressing butof humanizing himself; and he could humanize himself, he felt, onlyby constant reference to the accepted standard of what the normalman should be.
He refused to “pride himself on anything”; he wasfearful of over-emphasis, because the first of virtues in his eyeswas a sense of proportion.
The total symmetry of life to which thebest type of classicist refers back his every impulse, he apprehendsintuitively with the aid of his imagination.
The symmetry to which thepseudo-classicist refers back his impulses has ceased to be imaginativeand has become a mere conformity to an outer code or even to the rulesof etiquette; and so, instead of a deep imaginative insight, he getsmere elegance or polish.
The unity that a purely external decorum ofthis kind imposes on life degenerates into a tiresome sameness.
Itseems an unwarranted denial of the element of wonder and surprise.
Boredom was born one day of uniformity,” said La Motte Houdard, whowas himself a pseudo-classicist; whereas variety as everybody knowsis the spice of life.
The romanticist would break up the smooth andtiresome surface of artificial decorum by the pursuit of strangeness.
If he can only get his thrill he cares little whether it is probable,whether it bears any relation, that is, to normal human experience.
This sacrifice of the probable to the surprising appears, as I saidat the outset, in all types of romanticism--whether of action orthought or feeling.
The genuine classicist always puts his mainstress on design or structure; whereas the main quest of every typeof romanticist is rather for the intense and vivid and arrestingdetail.
Take, for instance, the intellectual romanticism that prevailedespecially in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.
Inthe “witty and conceited” poets of this period the intellect is engagedin a more or less irresponsible vagabondage with the imagination as itsfree accomplice.
The conceits by which a poet of this type displays his“ingenuity” (genius) are not structural, are not, that is, referredback to any centre.
They stand forth each separately and sharply fromthe surface of the style (hence known to the French as “points”), andso arrest the reader by their novelty.
Their rareness and preciousness,however, are intended to startle the intellect alone.
They do nothave and are not intended to have any power of sensuous suggestion.
The Rousseauistic romanticist, on the other hand, so far from being“metaphysical,” strives to be concrete even at the risk of a certainmaterialism of style, of turning his metaphors into mere images.
Likethe intellectual romanticist, though in a different way, he wishes tobreak up the smooth and monotonous surface of life and style, and so hesets up the cult of the picturesque.
To understand this cult one needsto remember the opposite extreme of artificial symmetry.
One needs torecall, for example, the neo-classicist who complained of the starsin heaven because they were not arranged in symmetrical patterns, orvarious other neo-classicists who attacked mountains because of theirrough and irregular shapes, because of their refusal to submit to therule and compass.
When beauty is conceived in so mechanical a fashionsome one is almost certain to wish to “add strangeness” to it.
The cult of the picturesque is closely associated with the cult oflocal color.
Here as elsewhere romantic genius is, in contradistinctionto classical genius which aims at the “grandeur of generality,” thegenius of wonder and surprise.
According to Buffon, who offers therare spectacle of a man of science who is at the same time a theoristof the grand manner, genius is shown in the architectonic gift--inthe power so to unify a subject as to keep its every detail in propersubordination to the whole.
Any mere wantoning of the imaginationin the pursuit of either the precious or the picturesque is to beseverely repressed if one is to attain to the grandeur of generality.
Buffon is truly classic in relating genius to design.
Unfortunatelyhe verges towards the pseudo-classic in his distrust of color, of theprecise word and the vivid descriptive epithet.
The growing verbalsqueamishness that so strikes one towards the end of the neo-classicperiod is one outcome of artificial decorum, of confusing nobility oflanguage with the language of the nobility.
There was an increasingfear of the trivial word that might destroy the illusion of the grandmanner, and also of the technical term that should be too suggestiveof specialization.
All terms were to be avoided that were not readilyintelligible to a lady or gentleman in the drawing-room.
And so itcame to pass that by the end of the eighteenth century the grandmanner, or elevated style, had come to be largely an art of ingeniouscircumlocution, and Buffon gives some countenance to this conception ofclassic dignity and representativeness when he declares that one shoulddescribe objects “only by the most general terms.
At all events thereply of the romantic genius to this doctrine is the demand for localcolor, for the concrete and picturesque phrase.
The general truth atwhich the classicist aims the Rousseauist dismisses as identical withthe gray and the academic, and bends all his efforts to the renderingof the vivid and unique detail.
Of the readiness of the romantic geniusto show (or one is tempted to say) to advertise his originality bytrampling verbal decorum under foot along with every other kind ofdecorum, I shall have more to say later.
He is ready to employ not onlythe homely and familiar word that the pseudo-classicist had eschewedas “low,” but words so local and technical as to be unintelligible toordinary readers.
Chateaubriand deals so specifically with the NorthAmerican Indian and his environment that the result, according toSainte-Beuve, is a sort of “tattooing” of his style.
Hugo bestows awhole dictionary of architectural terms upon the reader in his “NôtreDame,” and of nautical terms in his “Toilers of the Sea.
In order tofollow some of the passages in Balzac’s “César Birotteau,” one needsto be a lawyer or a professional accountant, and it has been said thatin order to do justice to a certain description in Zola one would needto be a pork-butcher.
In this movement towards a highly specializedvocabulary one should note a coöperation, as so often elsewhere,between the two wings of the naturalistic movement--the scientific andthe emotional.
The Rousseauist is, like the scientist, a specialist--hespecializes in his own sensations.
He goes in quest of emotionalthrills for their own sake, just as Napoleon’s generals, according toSainte-Beuve, waged war without any ulterior aim but for the sheer lustof conquest.
The vivid images and picturesque details are thereforenot sufficiently structural; each one tends to thrust itself forwardwithout reference to the whole and to demand attention for its own sake.
The pursuit of the unrelated thrill without reference to itsmotivation or probability leads in the romantic movement to a sort ofdescent--often, it is true, a rapturous and lyrical descent--from thedramatic to the melodramatic.
It is possible to trace this one-sidedemphasis on wonder not merely in vocabulary but in the increasingresort to the principle of contrast.
One suspects, for example, thatRousseau exaggerates the grotesqueness of his youthful failure as amusical composer at Lausanne in order that his success in the samerôle before the king and all the ladies of the court at Versailles may“stick more fiery off.
The contrast that Chateaubriand establishesbetween the two banks of the Mississippi at the beginning of his“Atala” is so complete as to put some strain on verisimilitude.
Onemay note in this same description, as a somewhat different way ofsacrificing the probable to the picturesque, the bears drunk on wildgrapes and reeling on the branches of the elms.
To prove that it waspossible on some particular occasion to look down the vista of a forestglade on the lower Mississippi and see it closed by a drunken bear doesnot meet the difficulty at all.
For art has to do, as was remarked longago, not with the possible but the probable; and a bear in this postureis a possible but scarcely a probable bear.
To return to the principle of contrast: Hugo dilates upon his puninessas an infant (“abandoned by everybody, even by his mother”) in orderto make his later achievement seem still more stupendous.
45 Theuse of the antithesis as the auxiliary of surprise, the abrupt andthrilling passage from light to shade or the contrary, finds perhapsits culminating expression in Hugo.
A study of this one figure as itappears in his words and ideas, in his characters and situations andsubjects, would show that he is the most melodramatic genius for whomhigh rank has ever been claimed in literature.
The suddenness of JeanValjean’s transformation from a convict into a saint may serve as asingle instance of Hugo’s readiness to sacrifice verisimilitude tosurprise in his treatment of character.
Closely allied to the desire to break up the monotonous surface of“good form” by the pointed and picturesque style in writing is the riseof the pointed and picturesque style in dress.
A man may advertisehis genius and originality (in the romantic sense of these terms) bydeparting from the accepted modes of costume as well as from theaccepted modes of speech.
Gautier’s scarlet waistcoat at the firstperformance of Hernani is of the same order as his flamboyant epithets,his riot of local color, and was at least as effective in achievingthe main end of his life--to be, in his own phrase, the “terror of thesleek, baldheaded bourgeois.
In assuming the Armenian garb to theastonishment of the rustics of Motiers-Travers, Rousseau anticipatesnot merely Gautier but innumerable other violators of conventionalcorrectness: here as elsewhere he deserves to rank as the classicinstance, one is tempted to say, of romantic eccentricity.
La Bruyère,an exponent of the traditional good-breeding against which Rousseauismis a protest, says that the gentleman allows himself to be dressed byhis tailor.
He wishes to be neither ahead of the mode nor behind it,being reluctant as he is in all things to oppose his private sense tothe general sense.
His point of view in the matter of dress is not sovery remote from that of a genuine classicism, whereas the enthusiastwho recently went about the streets of New York (until taken in bythe police) garbed as a contemporary of Pericles is no less plainly aproduct of Rousseauistic revolt.
Chateaubriand’s relation to Rousseauism in this matter calls forspecial comment.
He encouraged, and to some extent held, the beliefthat to show genius and originality one must be irregular andtempestuous in all things, even in the arrangement of one’s hair.
Atthe same time he preached reason.
His heart, in short, was romantic,his head classical.
Both as a classicist and a romanticist he was readyto repudiate on the one hand his master Rousseau, and on the otherhis own disciples.
As a romantic genius he wished to regard himselfas unique and so unrelated to Rousseau.
At the same time he alsolooked upon it as a sort of insolence for any of his own followers toaspire to such a lonely preëminence in grief as René.
As a classicisthe saw that great art aims at the normal and the representative, andthat it is therefore absurd for people to pattern themselves on suchmorbid and exceptional characters as René and Childe Harold.
Mostof the romanticists indeed showed themselves very imitative even intheir attempts at uniqueness, and the result was a second or thirdhand, or as one is tempted to say, a stale eccentricity.
In their merefollowing of the mode many of the French romanticists of 1830 wereready to impose a painful discipline upon themselves46 in order toappear abnormal, in order, for instance, to acquire a livid Byroniccomplexion.
Some of those who wished to seem elegiac like Lamartinerather than to emulate the violent and histrionic revolt of the Conradsand Laras actually succeeded, we are told, in giving themselvesconsumption (hence the epithet école poitrinaire).
In outer and visible freakishness the French romanticists of 1830probably bore away the palm, though in inner and spiritual remotenessfrom normal human experience they can scarcely vie with the earlyGerman romanticists.
And this is doubtless due to the fact that inFrance there was a more definite outer standard from which to advertisetheir departure, and also to the fact that the revolt against thisstandard was so largely participated in by the painters and by writerslike Gautier who were also interested in painting.
Chateaubriandwrites of the romantic painters (and the passage will also serve toillustrate his attitude towards his own disciples): “These artistsrig themselves up as comic sketches, as grotesques, as caricatures.
Some of them wear frightful mustaches, one would suppose that theyare going forth to conquer the world--their brushes are halberds,their paint-scratchers sabres; others have enormous beards and hairthat puffs out or hangs down their shoulders; they smoke a cigarvolcanically.
These cousins of the rainbow, to use a phrase of our oldRégnier, have their heads filled with deluges, seas, rivers, forests,cataracts, tempests, or it may be with slaughters, tortures andscaffolds.
One finds among them human skulls, foils, mandolins, helmetsand dolmans.
They aim to form a separate species between the ape andthe satyr; they give you to understand that the secrecy of the studiohas its dangers and that there is no safety for the models.
These purely personal eccentricities that so marked the early stages inthe warfare between the Bohemian and the philistine have as a matterof fact diminished in our own time.
Nowadays a man of the distinctionof Disraeli or even of Bulwer-Lytton47 would scarcely affect, asthey did, the flamboyant style in dress.
But the underlying failureto discriminate between the odd and the original has persisted and hasworked out into even extremer consequences.
One may note, as I havesaid, even in the early figures in the movement a tendency to play tothe gallery, a something that suggests the approach of the era of thelime-light and the big headline.
Rousseau himself has been called thefather of yellow journalists.
There is an unbroken development fromthe early exponents of original genius down to cubists, futurists andpost-impressionists and the corresponding schools in literature.
Thepartisans of expression as opposed to form in the eighteenth centuryled to the fanatics of expression in the nineteenth and these haveled to the maniacs of expression of the twentieth.
The extremists inpainting have got so far beyond Cézanne, who was regarded not long agoas one of the wildest of innovators, that Cézanne is, we are told, “ina fair way to achieve the unhappy fate of becoming a classic.
Poewas fond of quoting a saying of Bacon’s that “there is no excellentbeauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.
This sayingbecame known in France through Baudelaire’s rendering of Poe and wasoften ascribed to Poe himself.
It was taken to mean that the strangerone became the nearer one was getting to perfect beauty.
And if wegrant this view of beauty we must admit that some of the decadentssucceeded in becoming very beautiful indeed.
But the more the elementof proportion in beauty is sacrificed to strangeness the more theresult will seem to the normal man to be, not beauty at all, but ratheran esoteric cult of ugliness.
The romantic genius therefore denouncesthe normal man as a philistine and at the same time, since he cannotplease him, seeks at least to shock him and so capture his attentionby the very violence of eccentricity.
The saying I have quoted from Bacon is perhaps an early example of theinner alliance between things that superficially often seem remote--thescientific spirit and the spirit of romance.
Scientific discovery hasgiven a tremendous stimulus to wonder and curiosity, has encouraged apurely exploratory attitude towards life and raised an overwhelmingprepossession in favor of the new as compared with the old.
Baconianand Rousseauist evidently come together by their primary emphasis onnovelty.
The movement towards a more and more eccentric conceptionof art and literature has been closely allied in practice with thedoctrine of progress--and that from the very dawn of the so-calledQuarrel of Ancients and Moderns.
It is scarcely possible to exaggeratethe havoc that has been wrought by the transfer of the belief thatthe latest thing is the best--a belief that is approximately trueof automobiles--from the material order to an entirely differentrealm.
48 The very heart of the classical message, one cannot repeattoo often, is that one should aim first of all not to be original,but to be human, and that to be human one needs to look up to a soundmodel and imitate it.
The imposition of form and proportion upon one’sexpansive impulses which results from this process of imitation is,in the true sense of that much abused word, culture.
Genuine cultureis difficult and disciplinary.
The mediation that it involves betweenthe conflicting claims of form and expression requires the utmostcontention of spirit.
We have here a clue to the boundless successof the Rousseauistic doctrine of spontaneity, of the assertion thatgenius resides in the region of the primitive and unconscious and ishindered rather than helped by culture.
It is easier to be a geniuson Rousseauistic lines than to be a man on the terms imposed by theclassicist.
There is a fatal facility about creation when its qualityis not tested by some standard set above the creator’s temperament;and the same fatal facility appears in criticism when the critic doesnot test creation by some standard set above both his own temperamentand that of the creator.
The romantic critic as a matter of factconfines his ambition to receiving so keen an impression from genius,conceived as something purely temperamental, that when this creativeexpression is passed through his temperament it will issue forth as afresh expression.
Taste, he holds, will thus tend to become one withgenius, and criticism, instead of being cold and negative like that ofthe neo-classicist, will itself grow creative.
49 But the critic whodoes not get beyond this stage will have gusto, zest, relish, what youwill, he will not have taste.
For taste involves a difficult mediationbetween the element of uniqueness in both critic and creator and thatwhich is representative and human.
Once eliminate this human standardthat is set above the temperament of the creator and make of the criticin turn a mere pander to “genius” and it is hard to see what measureof a man’s excellence is left save his intoxication with himself; andthis measure would scarcely seem to be trustworthy.
Every ass that’sromantic,” says Wolseley in his Preface to “Valentinian” (1686)“believes he’s inspired.
An important aspect of the romantic theory of genius remains to beconsidered.
This theory is closely associated in its rise and growthwith the theory of the master faculty or ruling passion.
A man cando that for which he has a genius without effort, whereas no amountof effort can avail to give a man that for which he has no nativeaptitude.
50 Buffon affirmed in opposition to this view that genius isonly a capacity for taking pains or, as an American recently put it, isten per cent inspiration and ninety per cent perspiration.
This notionof genius not only risks running counter to the observed facts as tothe importance of the native gift but it does not bring out as clearlyas it might the real point at issue.
Even though genius were shownto be ninety per cent inspiration a man should still, the classicistwould insist, fix his attention on the fraction that is within hispower.
Thus Boileau says in substance at the outset of his “Art ofPoetry” that a poet needs to be born under a propitious star.
Geniusis indispensable, and not merely genius in general but genius for thespecial kind of poetry in which he is to excel.
Yet granting all this,he says to the poetical aspirant, bestir yourself! The mystery of gracewill always be recognized in any view of life that gets at all beneaththe surface.
Yet it is still the better part to turn to the feasibilityof works.
The view of genius as merely a temperamental overflow is asa matter of fact only a caricature of the doctrine of grace.
It suitsthe spiritual indolence of the creator who seeks to evade the moredifficult half of his problem--which is not merely to create but tohumanize his creation.
Hawthorne, for example, is according to Mr. Brownell, too prone (except in the “Scarlet Letter”) to get away fromthe clear sunlight of normal human experience into a region of somewhatcrepuscular symbolism, and this is because he yielded too complacentlyand fatalistically to what he conceived to be his genius.
The theoryof genius is perhaps the chief inheritance of the New Englandtranscendentalists from romanticism.
Hawthorne was more on his guardagainst the extreme implications of the theory than most other membersof this group.
It remains to be seen how much the exaltation of geniusand depreciation of culture that marks one whole side of Emerson willin the long run tell against his reputation.
The lesser New England menshowed a rare incapacity to distinguish between originality and merefreakishness either in themselves or in others.
It is fair to say that in lieu of the discipline of culture theromantic genius has often insisted on the discipline of technique;and this has been especially true in a country like France with itspersistent tradition of careful workmanship.
Gautier, for example,would have one’s “floating dream sealed”51 in the hardest and mostresisting material, that can only be mastered by the perfect craftsman;and he himself, falling into a confusion of the arts, tries to displaysuch a craftsmanship by painting and carving with words.
Flaubert,again, refines upon the technique of writing to a point where itbecomes not merely a discipline but a torture.
But if a man is tobe a romantic genius in the fullest sense he must, it should seem,repudiate even the discipline of technique as well as the discipline ofculture in favor of an artless spontaneity.
For after all the geniusis only the man who retains the virtues of the child, and technicalproficiency is scarcely to be numbered among these virtues.
The Germanromanticists already prefer the early Italian painters because of theirnaïveté and divine awkwardness to the later artiste who had a moreconscious mastery of their material.
The whole Pre-Raphaelite movementis therefore only one aspect of Rousseau’s return to nature.
To laterprimitivists the early Italians themselves seem far too deliberate.
They would recover the spontaneity displayed in the markings onAlaskan totem poles or in the scratchings of the caveman on theflint.
A prerequisite to pure genius, if we are to judge by their ownproductions, is an inability to draw.
The futurists in their endeavorto convey symbolically their own “soul” or “vision”--a vision be itnoted of pure flux and motion--deny the very conditions of time andspace that determine the special technique of painting; and inasmuchas to express one’s “soul” means for these moderns, as it did for the“genius” of the eighteenth century, to express the ineffable differencebetween themselves and others, the symbolizing of this soul to whichthey have sacrificed both culture and technique remains a dark mystery.
An eccentricity so extreme as to be almost or quite indistinguishablefrom madness is then the final outcome of the revolt of the originalgenius from the regularity of the eighteenth century.
The eighteenthcentury had, one must confess, become too much like the Happy Valleyfrom which Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia, sought an egress.
It was fairto the eye and satisfied all man’s ordinary needs, but it seemed at thesame time to hem him in oppressively, and limit unduly his horizons.
For the modern man, as for the prince in Johnson’s tale, a regularround of assured felicities has counted for nought as compared with thepassion for the open; though now that he has tasted strange adventures,the modern man will scarcely decide at the end, like the prince, to“return to Abyssinia.
I have already spoken of the rationalistic andpseudo-classic elements in the eighteenth century that the romanticrebels found so intolerable.
It is impossible to follow “reason,” theysaid in substance, and also to slake one’s thirst for the “infinite”;it is impossible to conform and imitate and at the same time to be freeand original and spontaneous.
Above all it is impossible to submitto the yoke of either reason or imitation and at the same time to beimaginative.
This last assertion will always be the main point at issuein any genuine debate between classicist and romanticist.
The supremething in life, the romanticist declares, is the creative imagination,and it can be restored to its rights only by repudiating imitation.
Theimagination is supreme the classicist grants but adds that to imitaterightly is to make the highest use of the imagination.
To understandall that is implied in this central divergence between classicistand romanticist we shall need to study in more detail the kind ofimaginative activity that has been encouraged in the whole movementextending from the rise of the original genius in the eighteenthcentury to the present day.
CHAPTER IIIROMANTIC IMAGINATIONI have already spoken of the contrast established by the theorists oforiginal genius in the eighteenth century between the different typesof imagination--especially between the literary and the scientificimagination.
According to these theorists, it will be remembered, thescientific imagination should be strictly subordinated to judgment,whereas the literary imagination, freed from the shackles of imitation,should be at liberty to wander wild in its own empire of chimeras,or, at all events, should be far less sharply checked by judgment.
It is easy to follow the extension of these English views of geniusand imagination into the France of Rousseau and Diderot, and thenthe elaboration of these same views, under the combined influence ofboth France and England, in Germany.
I have tried to show that Kant,especially in his “Critique of Judgment,” and Schiller in his “ÆstheticLetters” (1795) prepare the way for the conception of the creativeimagination that is at the very heart of the romantic movement.
According to this romantic conception, as we have seen, the imaginationis to be free, not merely from outer formalistic constraint, but fromall constraint whatever.
This extreme romantic emancipation of theimagination was accompanied by an equally extreme emancipation of theemotions.
Both kinds of emancipation are, as I have tried to show,a recoil partly from neo-classical judgment--a type of judgmentwhich seemed to oppress all that is creative and spontaneous in manunder a weight of outer convention; partly, from the reason of theEnlightenment, a type of reason that was so logical and abstract thatit seemed to mechanize the human spirit, and to be a denial of allthat is immediate and intuitive.
The neo-classical judgment, with itsundue unfriendliness to the imagination, is itself a recoil, let usremember, from the imaginative extravagance of the “metaphysicals,” theintellectual romanticists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,and also, if we take a sufficiently wide view, from the Quixotic typeof romanticism, the romanticism of action, that we associate with theMiddle Ages.
Now not only are men governed by their imaginations (the imagination,as Pascal says, disposes of everything), but the type of imaginationby which most men are governed may be defined in the widest senseof the word as romantic.
Nearly every man cherishes his dream, hisconceit of himself as he would like to be, a sort of “ideal” projectionof his own desires, in comparison with which his actual life seemsa hard and cramping routine.
Man must conceive himself what he isnot,” as Dr.
Johnson says, “for who is pleased with what he is?” Theample habitation that a man rears for his fictitious or “ideal” selfoften has some slight foundation in fact, but the higher he rearsit the more insecure it becomes, until finally, like Perrette inthe fable, he brings the whole structure down about his ears by thevery gesture of his dream.
We all of us,” La Fontaine concludes inperhaps the most delightful account of the romantic imagination inliterature, “wise as well as foolish, indulge in daydreams.
There isnothing sweeter.
A flattering illusion carries away our spirits.
Allthe wealth in the world is ours, all honors and all women,”52 etc.
When Johnson descants on the “dangerous prevalence of imagination,”53and warns us to stick to “sober probability,” what he means is thedangerous prevalence of day-dreaming.
The retreat of the Rousseauistinto some “land of chimeras” or tower of ivory assumes forms almostincredibly complex and subtle, but at bottom the ivory tower is onlyone form of man’s ineradicable longing to escape from the oppressionof the actual into some land of heart’s desire, some golden age offancy.
As a matter of fact, Rousseau’s imaginative activity oftenapproaches very closely to the delights of day-dreaming as describedby La Fontaine.
He was never more imaginative, he tells us, thanwhen on a walking-trip--especially when the trip had no definitegoal, or at least when he could take his time in reaching it.
TheWanderlust of body and spirit could then be satisfied together.
Actual vagabondage seemed to be an aid to the imagination in its escapefrom verisimilitude.
One should note especially Rousseau’s account ofhis early wandering from Lyons to Paris and the airy structures thathe raised on his anticipations of what he might find there.
Inasmuchas he was to be attached at Paris to the Swiss Colonel Godard, healready traced for himself in fancy, in spite of his short-sightedness,a career of military glory.
I had read that Marshal Schomberg wasshort-sighted, why shouldn’t Marshal Rousseau be so too?” In themeanwhile, touched by the sight of the groves and brooks, “I felt inthe midst of my glory that my heart was not made for so much turmoil,and soon without knowing how, I found myself once more among my belovedpastorals, renouncing forever the toils of Mars.
Thus alongside the real world and in more or less sharp opposition toit, Rousseau builds up a fictitious world, that pays des chimères,which is alone, as he tells us, worthy of habitation.
To study hisimaginative activity is simply to study the new forms that he givesto what I have called man’s ineradicable longing for some Arcadia,some land of heart’s desire.
Goethe compares the illusions that mannourishes in his breast to the population of statues in ancient Romewhich were almost as numerous as the population of living men.
Theimportant thing from the point of view of sanity is that a man shouldnot blur the boundaries between the two populations, that he should notcease to discriminate between his fact and his fiction.
If he confuseswhat he dreams himself to be with what he actually is, he has alreadyentered upon the pathway of madness.
It was, for example, naturalfor a youth like Rousseau who was at once romantic and musical, todream that he was a great composer; but actually to set up as a greatcomposer and to give the concert at Lausanne, shows an unwillingness todiscriminate between his fictitious and his real world that is plainlypathological.
If not already a megalomaniac, he was even then on theway to megalomania.
To wander through the world as though it were an Arcadia or enchantedvision contrived for one’s especial benefit is an attitude ofchildhood--especially of imaginative childhood.
Wherever childrenare,” says Novalis, “there is the golden age.
As the child grows andmatures there is a more or less painful process of adjustment betweenhis “vision” and the particular reality in which he is placed.
A littlesense gets knocked into his head, and often, it must be confessed, agood deal of the imagination gets knocked out.
As Wordsworth complains,the vision fades into the light of common day.
The striking fact aboutRousseau is that, far more than Wordsworth, he held fast to his vision.
He refused to adjust it to an unpalatable reality.
During the veryyears when the ordinary youth is forced to subordinate his luxuriousimaginings to some definite discipline he fell under the influence ofMadame de Warens who encouraged rather than thwarted his Arcadian bent.
Later, when almost incurably confirmed in his penchant for revery, hecame into contact with the refined society of Paris, an environmentrequiring so difficult an adjustment that no one we are told couldaccomplish the feat unless he had been disciplined into the appropriatehabits from the age of six.
He is indeed the supreme example of theunadjusted man, of the original genius whose imagination has neversuffered either inner or outer constraint, who is more of an Arcadiandreamer at sixty perhaps than he was at sixteen.
He writes to theBailli de Mirabeau (31 January, 1767):    “The fatigue of thinking becomes every day more painful to me.
I love to dream, but freely, allowing my mind to wander without    enslaving myself to any subject.
This idle and contemplative    life which you do not approve and which I do not excuse,    becomes to me daily more delicious; to wander alone endlessly    and ceaselessly among the trees and rocks about my dwelling,    to muse or rather to be as irresponsible as I please, and as    you say, to go wool-gathering; … finally to give myself up    unconstrainedly to my fantasies which, thank heaven, are all    within my power: that, sir, is for me the supreme enjoyment,    than which I can imagine nothing superior in this world for a    man at my age and in my condition.
Rousseau, then, owes his significance not only to the fact that he wassupremely imaginative in an age that was disposed to deny the supremacyof the imagination, but to the fact that he was imaginative in aparticular way.
A great multitude since his time must be reckoned amonghis followers, not because they have held certain ideas but becausethey have exhibited a similar quality of imagination.
In seeking todefine this quality of imagination we are therefore at the very heartof our subject.
It is clear from what has already been said that Rousseau’s imaginationwas in a general way Arcadian, and this, if not the highest, is perhapsthe most prevalent type of imagination.
In surveying the literature ofthe world one is struck not only by the universality of the pastoralor idyllic element, but by the number of forms it has assumed--formsranging from the extreme of artificiality and conventionalism to thepurest poetry.
The very society against the artificiality of whichRousseau’s whole work is a protest is itself in no small degree apastoral creation.
Various elements indeed entered into the life ofthe drawing-room as it came to be conceived towards the beginningof the seventeenth century.
The Marquise de Rambouillet and otherswho set out at this time to live in the grand manner were in sofar governed either by genuine or by artificial decorum.
But at thesame time that the creators of le grand monde were aiming to bemore “decent” than the men and women of the sixteenth century, theywere patterning themselves upon the shepherds and shepherdesses ofD’Urfé’s interminable pastoral “l’Astrée.
They were seeking to createa sort of enchanted world from which the harsh cares of ordinary lifewere banished and where they might be free, like true Arcadians, todiscourse of love.
This discourse of love was associated with whatI have defined as intellectual romanticism.
In spite of the attacksby the exponents of humanistic good sense (Molière, Boileau, etc.
on this drawing-room affectation, it lingered on and still led inthe eighteenth century, as Rousseau complained, to “inconceivablerefinements.
54 At the same time we should recollect that there isa secret bond between all forms of Arcadian dreaming.
Not only wasRousseau fascinated, like the early précieux and précieuses, byD’Urfé’s pastoral, but he himself appealed by his renewal of the mainpastoral theme of love to the descendants of these former Arcadiansin the polite society of his time.
The love of Rousseau is associatednot like that of the précieux, with the intellect, but with theemotions, and so he substitutes for a “wire-drawn and super-subtilizedgallantry,” the ground-swell of elemental passion.
55 Moreover, thedefinitely primitivistic coloring that he gave to his imaginativerenewal of the pastoral dream appealed to an age that was reaching thelast stages of over-refinement.
Primitivism is, strictly speaking,nothing new in the world.
It always tends to appear in periods ofcomplex civilization.
The charms of the simple life and of a returnto nature were celebrated especially during the Alexandrian periodof Greek literature for the special delectation no doubt of the mostsophisticated members of this very sophisticated society.
Nothing,” asDr.
Santayana says, “is farther from the common people than the corruptdesire to be primitive.
Primitivistic dreaming was also popularin ancient Rome at its most artificial moment.
The great ancients,however, though enjoying the poetry of the primitivistic dream, werenot the dupes of this dream.
Horace, for example, lived at the mostartificial moment of Rome when primitivistic dreaming was popular asit had been at Alexandria.
He descants on the joys of the simple lifein a well-known ode.
One should not therefore hail him, like Schiller,as the founder of the sentimental school “of which he has remained theunsurpassed model.
56 For the person who plans to return to naturein Horace’s poem is the old usurer Alfius, who changes his mind atthe last moment and puts out his mortgages again.
In short, the finalattitude of the urbane Horace towards the primitivistic dream--it couldhardly be otherwise--is ironical.
Rousseau seems destined to remain the supreme example, at least in theOccident, of the man who takes the primitivistic dream seriously, whoattempts to set up primitivism as a philosophy and even as a religion.
Rousseau’s account of his sudden illumination on the road from Paristo Vincennes is famous: the scales, he tells us, fell from his eyeseven as they had from the eyes of Paul on the road to Damascus, andhe saw how man had fallen from the felicity of his primitive estate;how the blissful ignorance in which he had lived at one with himselfand harmless to his fellows had been broken by the rise of intellectualself-consciousness and the resulting progress in the sciences andarts.
Modern students of Rousseau have, under the influence of James,taken this experience on the road to Vincennes to be an authenticcase of conversion,57 but this is merely one instance of our moderntendency to confound the subrational with the superrational.
What onefinds in this alleged conversion when one looks into it, is a sort of“subliminal uprush” of the Arcadian memories of his youth, especiallyof his life at Annecy and Les Charmettes, and at the same time thecontrast between these Arcadian memories and the hateful constraintshe had suffered at Paris in his attempts to adjust himself to anuncongenial environment.
We can trace even more clearly perhaps the process by which theArcadian dreamer comes to set up as a seer, in Rousseau’s relation ofthe circumstances under which he came to compose his “Discourse on theOrigins of Inequality.
He goes off on a sort of picnic with Thérèseinto the forest of St.
Germain and gives himself up to imagining thestate of primitive man.
Plunged in the forest,” he says, “I soughtand found there the image of primitive times of which I proudlydrew the history; I swooped down on the little falsehoods of men; Iventured to lay bare their nature, to follow the progress of time andof circumstances which have disfigured it, and comparing artificialman (l’homme de l’homme) with natural man, to show in his allegedimprovement the true source of his miseries.
My soul, exalted by thesesublime contemplations, rose into the presence of the Divinity.
Seeingfrom this vantage point that the blind pathway of prejudices followedby my fellows was also that of their errors, misfortunes and crimes, Icried out to them in a feeble voice that they could not hear: Madmen,who are always complaining of nature, know that all your evils comefrom yourselves alone.
The golden age for which the human heart has an ineradicable longingis here presented not as poetical, which it certainly is, but as a“state of nature” from which man has actually fallen.
The more or lessinnocent Arcadian dreamer is being transformed into the dangerousUtopist.
He puts the blame of the conflict and division of which he isconscious in himself upon the social conventions that set bounds tohis temperament and impulses; once get rid of these purely artificialrestrictions and he feels that he will again be at one with himself and“nature.
With such a vision of nature as this it is not surprisingthat every constraint is unendurable to Rousseau, that he likes, asBerlioz was to say of himself later, to “make all barriers crack.
He is ready to shatter all the forms of civilized life in favor ofsomething that never existed, of a state of nature that is only theprojection of his own temperament and its dominant desires upon thevoid.
His programme amounts in practice to the indulgence of infiniteindeterminate desire, to an endless and aimless vagabondage of theemotions with the imagination as their free accomplice.
This longing of the highly sophisticated person to get back to theprimitive and naïve and unconscious, or what amounts to the samething, to shake off the trammels of tradition and reason in favor offree and passionate self-expression, underlies, as I have pointed out,the conception of original genius which itself underlies the wholemodern movement.
A book reflecting the primitivistic trend of theeighteenth century, and at the same time pointing the way, as we shallsee presently, to the working out of the fundamental primitivisticcontrast between the natural and the artificial in the romanticismof the early nineteenth century, is Schiller’s “Essay on Simple andSentimental Poetry.
The poetry that does not “look before or after,”that is free from self-questioning and self-consciousness, and has achildlike spontaneity, Schiller calls simple or naïve.
The poet, on theother hand, who is conscious of his fall from nature and who, from themidst of his sophistication, longs to be back once more at his mother’sbosom, is sentimental.
Homer and his heroes, for example, are naïve;Werther, who yearns in a drawing-room for the Homeric simplicity, issentimental.
The longing of the modern man for nature, says Schiller,is that of the sick man for health.
It is hard to see in Schiller’s“nature” anything more than a development of Rousseau’s primitivisticArcadia.
To be sure, Schiller warns us that, in order to recover thechildlike and primitive virtues still visible in the man of genius,we must not renounce culture.
We must not seek to revert lazily toan Arcadia, but must struggle forward to an Elysium.
UnfortunatelySchiller’s Elysium has a strange likeness to Rousseau’s Arcadia; andthat is because Schiller’s own conception of life is, in the lastanalysis, overwhelmingly sentimental.
His most Elysian conception,that of a purely æsthetic Greece, a wonderland of unalloyed beauty, isalso a bit of Arcadian sentimentalizing.
Inasmuch as Rousseau’s stateof nature never existed outside of dreamland, the Greek who is simpleor naïve in this sense is likewise a myth.
He has no real counterparteither in the Homeric age or any other age of Greece.
It is hard tosay which is more absurd, to make the Greeks naïve, or to turn Horaceinto a sentimentalist.
One should note how this romantic perversionof the Greeks for which Schiller is largely responsible is relatedto his general view of the imagination.
We have seen that in the“Æsthetic Letters” he maintains that if the imagination is to conceivethe ideal it must be free; and that to be free it must be emancipatedfrom purpose and engage in a sort of play.
If the imagination has tosubordinate itself to a real object it ceases in so far to be free.
Hence the more ideal the imagination the farther it gets away from areal object.
By his theory of the imagination, Schiller thus encouragesthat opposition between the ideal and the real which figures so largelyin romantic psychology.
A man may consent to adjust a mere dream tothe requirements of the real, but when his dream is promoted to thedignity of an ideal it is plain that he will be less ready to makethe sacrifice.
Schiller’s Greece is very ideal in the sense I havejust defined.
It hovers before the imagination as a sort of GoldenAge of pure beauty, a land of chimeras that is alone worthy of theæsthete’s habitation.
As an extreme type of the romantic Hellenist,one may take Hölderlin, who was a disciple at once of Schiller and ofRousseau.
He begins by urging emancipation from every form of outerand traditional control in the name of spontaneity.
Boldly forget,”he cries in the very accents of Rousseau, “what you have inherited andwon--all laws and customs--and like new-born babes lift up your eyesto godlike nature.
Hölderlin has been called a “Hellenizing Werther,”and Werther, one should recollect, is only a German Saint-Preux, who isin turn, according to Rousseau’s own avowal, only an idealized imageof Rousseau.
The nature that Hölderlin worships and which is, like thenature of Rousseau, only an Arcadian intoxication of the imagination,he associates with a Greece which is, like the Greece of Schiller,a dreamland of pure beauty.
He longs to escape into this dreamlandfrom an actual world that seems to him intolerably artificial.
Thecontrast between his “ideal” Greece and reality is so acute as to makeall attempt at adjustment out of the question.
As a result of thismaladjustment his whole being finally gave way and he lingered on formany years in madness.
The acuteness of the opposition between the ideal and the real inHölderlin recalls Shelley, who was also a romantic Hellenist, and atthe same time perhaps the most purely Rousseauistic of the Englishromantic poets.
But Shelley was also a political dreamer, and here oneshould note two distinct phases in his dream: a first phase that isfilled with the hope of transforming the real world into an Arcadia58through revolutionary reform; and then a phase of elegiac disillusionwhen the gap between reality and his ideal refuses to be bridged.
59Something of the same radiant political hope and the same disillusionis found in Wordsworth.
In the first flush of his revolutionaryenthusiasm, France seemed to him to be “standing on the top of goldenhours” and pointing the way to a new birth of human nature:    Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,    But to be young was very heaven! O times,    In which the meagre stale forbidding ways    Of custom, law and statute, took at once    The attraction of a country in romance!When it became evident that the actual world and Utopia did notcoincide after all, when the hard sequences of cause and effect thatbind the present inexorably to the past refused to yield to thecreations of the romantic imagination, what ensued in Wordsworthwas not so much an awakening to true wisdom as a transformation ofthe pastoral dream.
The English Lake Country became for him in somemeasure as it was later to be for Ruskin, the ivory tower into whichhe retreated from the oppression of the real.
He still continued tosee, if not the general order of society, at least the denizens of hischosen retreat through the Arcadian mist, and contrasted their pastoralfelicity with the misery of men “barricadoed in the walls of cities.
Ido not mean to disparage the poetry of humble life or to deny that manypassages may be cited from Wordsworth that justify his reputation as aninspired teacher: I wish merely to point out here and elsewhere what isspecifically romantic in the quality of his imagination.
After all it is to Rousseau himself even more than to his German orEnglish followers that one needs to turn for the best examples ofthe all-pervasive conflict between the ideal and the actual.
Thepsychology of this conflict is revealed with special clearness in thefour letters that he wrote to M.
de Malesherbes, and into which he hasperhaps put more of himself than into any other similar amount of hiswriting.
His natural indolence and impatience at the obligations andconstraints of life were, he avows to M.
de Malesherbes, increasedby his early reading.
At the age of eight he already knew Plutarchby heart and had read “all novels” and shed tears over them, he adds“by the pailful.
Hence was formed his “heroic and romantic taste”which filled him with aversion for everything that did not resemblehis dreams.
He had hoped at first to find the equivalent of thesedreams among actual men, but after painful disillusions he had cometo look with disdain on his age and his contemporaries.
I withdrewmore and more from human society and created for myself a societyin my imagination, a society that charmed me all the more in that Icould cultivate it without peril or effort and that it was always atmy call and such as I required it.
He associated this dream societywith the forms of outer nature.
The long walks in particular that hetook during his stay at the Hermitage were, he tells us, filled witha “continual delirium” of this kind.
I peopled nature with beingsaccording to my heart.
I created for myself a golden age to suit myfancy.
It is not unusual for a man thus to console himself for hispoverty in the real relations of life by accumulating a huge hoard offairy gold.
Where the Rousseauist goes beyond the ordinary dreamer isin his proneness to regard his retirement into some land of chimeras asa proof of his nobility and distinction.
Poetry and life he feels areirreconcilably opposed to each other, and he for his part is on theside of poetry and the “ideal.
Goethe symbolized the hopelessness ofthis conflict in the suicide of the young Werther.
But though Wertherdied, his creator continued to live, and more perhaps than any otherfigure in the whole Rousseauistic movement perceived the peril of thisconception of poetry and the ideal.
He saw phantasts all about him whorefused to be reconciled to the gap between the infinitude of theirlonging and the platitude of their actual lot.
Perhaps no country andtime ever produced more such phantasts than Germany of the Storm andStress and romantic periods--partly no doubt because it did not offerany proper outlet for the activity of generous youths.
Goethe himselfhad been a phantast, and so it was natural in works like his “Tasso”that he should show himself specially preoccupied with the problemof the poet and his adjustment to life.
About the time that he wrotethis play, he was, as he tells us, very much taken up with thoughts of“Rousseau and his hypochondriac misery.
Rousseau for his part felta kinship between himself and Tasso, and Goethe’s Tasso certainlyreminds us very strongly of Rousseau.
Carried away by his Arcadianimaginings, Tasso violates the decorum that separates him from theprincess with whom he has fallen in love.
As a result of the rebuffsthat follow, his dream changes into a nightmare, until he finally fallslike Rousseau into wild and random suspicion and looks on himself asthe victim of a conspiracy.
In opposition to Tasso is the figure ofAntonio, the man of the world, whose imagination does not run away withhis sense of fact, and who is therefore equal to the “demands of theday.
The final reconciliation between Tasso and Antonio, if not veryconvincing dramatically, symbolizes at least what Goethe achieved insome measure in his own life.
There were moments, he declares, whenhe might properly look upon himself as mad, like Rousseau.
He escapedfrom this world of morbid brooding, this giddy downward gazing intothe bottomless pit of the romantic heart against which he utters awarning in Tasso, by his activity at the court of Weimar, by classicalculture, by scientific research.
Goethe carries the same problem ofreconciling the ideal to the real a stage further in his “WilhelmMeister.
The more or less irresponsible and Bohemian youth that wesee at the beginning learns by renunciation and self-limitation tofit into a life of wholesome activity.
Goethe saw that the remedy forromantic dreaming is work, though he is open to grave criticism, as Ishall try to show elsewhere, for his unduly naturalistic conception ofwork.
But the romanticists as a rule did not wish work in any sense andso, attracted as they were by the free artistic life of Meister at thebeginning, they looked upon his final adjustment to the real as a basecapitulation to philistinism.
Novalis described the book as a “Candidedirected against poetry,” and set out to write a counterblast in“Heinrich von Ofterdingen.
This apotheosis of pure poetry, as he meantit to be, is above all an apotheosis of the wildest vagabondage of theimagination.
Novalis did not, however, as a result of the conflictbetween the ideal and the real, show any signs of going mad likeHölderlin, or of simply fading from life like his friend Wackenroder.
Like E.
T.
A.
Hoffmann and a certain number of other phantasts he hada distinct gift for leading a dual life--for dividing himself intoa prosaic self which went one way, and a poetical self which wentanother.
This necessary and fatal opposition between poetry and prose theromanticist saw typified in “Don Quixote,” and of course he sided withthe idealism of the knight against the philistine good sense of SanchoPanza; and so for the early romanticists as well as for those who wereof their spiritual posterity,--Heine, for example, and Flaubert,--“DonQuixote” was a book to evoke not laughter but tears.
To the romantic conception of the ideal can be traced the increasinglack of understanding between the poet, or in general the creator, andthe public during the past century.
Many neo-classical writers may,like Boileau, have shown an undue reverence for what they conceived tobe the general sense of their time, but to measure one’s inspirationby one’s remoteness from this general sense is surely a far moredangerous error; and yet one was encouraged to do this very thing bythe views of original genius that were held in the eighteenth century.
Certain late neo-classicists lacked imagination and were at the sametime always harping on good sense.
It was therefore assumed that toinsist on good sense was necessarily proof of a lack of imagination.
Because the attempt to achieve the universal had led to a stale andlifeless imitation it was assumed that a man’s genius consists inhis uniqueness, in his unlikeness to other men.
Now nothing is moreprivate and distinctive in a man than his feelings, so that to beunique meant practically for Rousseau and his followers to be uniquein feeling.
Feeling alone they held was vital and immediate.
As amatter of fact the element in a man’s nature that he possesses incommon with other men is also something that he senses, somethingthat is in short intuitive and immediate.
But good sense the geniusidentifies with lifeless convention and so measures his originality bythe distance of his emotional and imaginative recoil from it.
Of thiswarfare between sense and sensibility that begins in the eighteenthcentury, the romantic war between the poet and the philistine is onlythe continuation.
This war has been bad for both artist and public.
Ifthe artist has become more and more eccentric, it must be confessedthat the good sense of the public against which he has protestedhas been too flatly utilitarian.
The poet who reduces poetry to theimaginative quest of strange emotional adventure, and the plaincitizen who does not aspire beyond a reality that is too literal andprosaic, both suffer; but the æsthete suffers the more severely--somuch so that I shall need to revert to this conception of poetry inmy treatment of romantic melancholy.
It leads at last to a contrastbetween the ideal and the real such as is described by Anatole Francein his account of Villiers de l’Isle Adam.
For thirty years,” says M.
France, “Villiers wandered around in cafés at night, fading away likea shadow at the first glimmer of dawn.
His poverty, the frightfulpoverty of cities, had so put its stamp on him and fashioned him sothoroughly that he resembled those vagabonds, who, dressed in black,sleep on park benches.
He had the livid complexion with red blotches,the glassy eye, the bowed back of the poor; and yet I am not sure weshould call him unhappy, for he lived in a perpetual dream and thatdream was radiantly golden.
His dull eyes contemplated within himselfdazzling spectacles.
He passed through the world like a somnambulistseeing nothing of what we see and seeing things that it is not givenus to behold.
Out of the commonplace spectacle of life he succeeded increating an ever fresh ecstasy.
On those ignoble café tables in themidst of the odor of beer and tobacco, he poured forth floods of purpleand gold.
This notion that literal failure is ideal success, and conversely, hasbeen developed in a somewhat different form by Rostand in his “Cyranode Bergerac.
By his refusal to compromise or adjust himself to thingsas they are, Cyrano’s real life has become a series of defeats.
He isfinally forced from life by a league of all the mediocrities whom hisidealism affronts.
His discomfiture is taken to show, not that he isa Quixotic extremist, but that he is the superior of the successfulGuise, the man who has stooped to compromise, the French equivalentof the Antonio whom Goethe finally came to prefer to Tasso.
Rostand’s“Chanticleer” is also an interesting study of romantic idealism andof the two main stages through which it passes--the first stage whenone relates one’s ideal to the real; the second, when one discoversthat the ideal and the real are more or less hopelessly dissevered.
Chanticleer still maintains his idealistic pose even after he hasdiscovered that the sun is not actually made to rise by his crowing.
In this hugging of his illusion in defiance of reality Chanticleeris at the opposite pole from Johnson’s astronomer in “Rasselas” whothinks that he has control of the weather, but when disillusioned ishumbly thankful at having escaped from this “dangerous prevalenceof imagination,” and entered once more into the domain of “soberprobability.
The problem, then, of the genius or the artist versus the philistinehas persisted without essential modification from the eighteenthcentury to the present day--from the suicide of Chatterton, let ussay, to the suicide of John Davidson.
The man of imagination spurnsin the name of his “ideal” the limits imposed upon it by a dullrespectability, and then his ideal turns out only too often to lackpositive content and to amount in practice to the expansion of infiniteindeterminate desire.
What the idealist opposes to the real is not onlysomething that does not exist, but something that never can exist.
TheArcadian revery which should be allowed at most as an occasional solacefrom the serious business of living is set up as a substitute forliving.
The imaginative and emotional dalliance of the Rousseauisticromanticist may assume a bewildering variety of forms.
We have alreadyseen in the case of Hölderlin how easily Rousseau’s dream of a stateof nature passes over--and that in spite of Rousseau’s attacks onthe arts--into the dream of a paradise of pure beauty.
The momentousmatter is not that a man’s imagination and emotions go out towardsthis or that particular haven of refuge in the future or in the past,in the East or in the West, but that his primary demand on life is forsome haven of refuge; that he longs to be away from the here and nowand their positive demands on his character and will.
Poe may sing of“the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome,” but heis not therefore a classicist.
With the same wistfulness innumerableromanticists have looked towards the Middle Ages.
So C.
E.
Nortonsays that Ruskin was a white-winged anachronism,60 that he shouldhave been born in the thirteenth century.
But one may surmise that aman with Ruskin’s special quality of imagination would have failedto adjust himself to the actual life of the thirteenth or any othercentury.
Those who put their Arcadia in the Middle Ages or some otherperiod of the past have at least this advantage over those who put itin the present, they are better protected against disillusion.
The manwhose Arcadia is distant from him merely in space may decide to go andsee for himself, and the results of this overtaking of one’s dream aresomewhat uncertain.
The Austrian poet Lenau, for example, actuallytook a trip to his primitive paradise that he had imagined somewherein the neighborhood of Pittsburgh.
Perhaps it is not surprising thathe finally died mad.
The disenchantment of Chateaubriand in his questfor a Rousseauistic Arcadia in America and for Arcadian savages Idescribe later.
In his journey into the wilderness Chateaubriandreveals himself as a spiritual lotos-eater no less surely than the manwho takes flight into what is superficially most remote from the virginforest--into some palace of art.
His attitude towards America does notdiffer psychically from that of many early romanticists towards Italy.
Italy was their land of heart’s desire, the land that filled them withineffable longing (Sehnsucht nach Italien), a palace of art that,like the Latin Quarter of later Bohemians, had some points of contactwith Mohammed’s paradise.
A man may even develop a romantic longing forthe very period against which romanticism was originally a protest andbe ready to “fling his cap for polish and for Pope.
One should addthat the romantic Eldorado is not necessarily rural.
Lamb’s attitudetowards London is almost as romantic as that of Wordsworth towards thecountry.
Dr.
Johnson cherished urban life because of its centrality.
Lamb’s imaginative dalliance, on the other hand, is stimulated by thesheer variety and wonder of the London streets as another’s might beby the mountains or the sea.
61 Lamb could also find an Elysium ofunmixed æsthetic solace in the literature of the past--especially inRestoration Comedy.
The essence of the mood is always the straining of the imagination awayfrom the here and now, from an actuality that seems paltry and fadedcompared to the radiant hues of one’s dream.
The classicist, accordingto A.
W.
Schlegel,62 is for making the most of the present, whereasthe romanticist hovers between recollection and hope.
In Shelleyanphrase he “looks before and after and pines for what is not.
Heinclines like the Byronic dandy, Barbey d’Aurevilly, to take for hismottoes the words “Too late” and “Nevermore.
Nostalgia, the term that has come to be applied to the infiniteindeterminate longing of the romanticist--his never-ending questafter the ever-fleeting object of desire--is not, from the point ofview of strict etymology, well-chosen.
Romantic nostalgia is not“homesickness,” accurately speaking, but desire to get away fromhome.
Odysseus in Homer suffers from true nostalgia.
The Ulysses ofTennyson, on the other hand, is nostalgic in the romantic sense when heleaves home “to sail beyond the sunset.
Ovid, as Goethe points out,is highly classical even in his melancholy.
The longing from whichhe suffers in his exile is very determinate: he longs to get back toRome, the centre of the world.
Ovid indeed sums up the classic pointof view when he says that one cannot desire the unknown (ignotinulla cupido).
63 The essence of nostalgia is the desire for theunknown.
I was burning with desire,” says Rousseau, “without anydefinite object.
One is filled with a desire to fly one knows notwhither, to be off on a journey into the blue distance.
64 Music isexalted by the romanticists above all other arts because it is themost nostalgic, the art that is most suggestive of the hopeless gapbetween the “ideal” and the “real.
Music,” in Emerson’s phrase,“pours on mortals its beautiful disdain.
Away! away!” cries Jean Paulto Music.
Thou speakest of things which throughout my endless life Ihave found not, and shall not find.
In musical and other nostalgia,the feelings receive a sort of infinitude from the coöperation of theimagination; and this infinitude, this quest of something that mustever elude one, is at the same time taken to be the measure of one’sidealism.
The symmetry and form that the classicist gains from workingwithin bounds are no doubt excellent, but then the willingness to workwithin bounds betokens a lack of aspiration.
If the primitivist isready, as some one has complained, to turn his back on the bright formsof Olympus and return to the ancient gods of chaos and of night, theexplanation is to be sought in this idea of the infinite.
It finallybecomes a sort of Moloch to which he is prepared to sacrifice mostof the values of civilized life.
The chief fear of the classicist isto be thought monstrous.
The primitivist on the contrary is inclinedto see a proof of superior amplitude of spirit in mere grotesquenessand disproportion.
The creation of monsters is, as Hugo says, a“satisfaction due to the infinite.
65The breaking down by the emotional romanticist of the barriers thatseparate not merely the different literary genres but the differentarts is only another aspect of his readiness to follow the lureof the infinite.
The title of a recent bit of French decadentverse--“Nostalgia in Blue Minor”--would already have been perfectlyintelligible to a Tieck or a Novalis.
The Rousseauist--and that from avery early stage in the movement--does not hesitate to pursue his everreceding dream across all frontiers, not merely those that separate artfrom art, but those that divide flesh from spirit and even good fromevil, until finally he arrives like Blake at a sort of “Marriage ofHeaven and Hell.
When he is not breaking down barriers in the name ofthe freedom of the imagination he is doing so in the name of what he ispleased to term love.
The ancient art and poetry,” says A.
W.
Schlegel, “rigorously    separate things which are dissimilar; the romantic delights    in indissoluble mixtures.
All contrarieties: nature and art,    poetry and prose, seriousness and mirth, recollection and    anticipation, spirituality and sensuality, terrestrial and    celestial, life and death, are by it blended together in the    most intimate combination.
As the oldest lawgivers delivered    their mandatory instructions and prescriptions in measured    melodies; as this is fabulously ascribed to Orpheus, the first    softener of the yet untamed race of mortals; in like manner    the whole of the ancient poetry and art is, as it were a    rhythmical nomos (law), an harmonious promulgation of the    permanently established legislation of a world submitted to a    beautiful order, and reflecting in itself the eternal images of    things.
Romantic poetry, on the other hand, is the expression    of the secret attraction to a chaos which lies concealed in    the very bosom of the ordered universe, and is perpetually    striving after new and marvellous births; the life-giving    spirit of primal love broods here anew on the face of the    waters.
The former is more simple, clear, and like to nature in    the self-existent perfection of her separate works; the latter,    notwithstanding its fragmentary appearance, approaches more to    the secret of the universe.
For Conception can only comprise    each object separately, but nothing in truth can ever exist    separately and by itself; Feeling perceives all in all at one    and the same time.
66Note the assumption here that the clear-cut distinctions of classicismare merely abstract and intellectual, and that the only true unity isthe unity of feeling.
In passages of this kind A.
W.
Schlegel is little more than thepopularizer of the ideas of his brother Friedrich.
Perhaps no one inthe whole romantic movement showed a greater genius for confusion thanFriedrich Schlegel; no one, in Nietzsche’s phrase, had a more intimateknowledge of all the bypaths to chaos.
Now it is from the German groupof which Friedrich Schlegel was the chief theorist that romanticismas a distinct and separate movement takes its rise.
We may thereforepause appropriately at this point to consider briefly how the epithetromantic of which I have already sketched the early history came tobe applied to a distinct school.
In the latter part of the eighteenthcentury, it will be remembered, romantic had become a fairly frequentword in English and also (under English influence) a less frequent,though not rare word, in French and German; it was often used favorablyin all these countries as applied to nature, and usually indeed inthis sense in France and Germany; but in England, when applied tohuman nature and as the equivalent of the French romanesque, it hadordinarily an unfavorable connotation; it signified the “dangerousprevalence of imagination” over “sober probability,” as may be seenin Foster’s essay “On the Epithet Romantic.
One may best preface adiscussion of the next step--the transference of the word to a distinctmovement--by a quotation from Goethe’s Conversations with Eckermann (21March, 1830):    “This division of poetry into classic and romantic,” says    Goethe, “which is to-day diffused throughout the whole world    and has caused so much argument and discord, comes originally    from Schiller and me.
It was my principle in poetry always to    work objectively.
Schiller on the contrary wrote nothing that    was not subjective; he thought his manner good, and to defend    it he wrote his article on naïve and sentimental poetry.
The    Schlegels got hold of this idea, developed it and little by    little it has spread throughout the whole world.
Everybody is    talking of romanticism and classicism.
Fifty years ago nobody    gave the matter a thought.
One statement in this passage of Goethe’s is perhaps open toquestion--that concerning the obligation of the Schlegels, or ratherFriedrich Schlegel, to Schiller’s treatise.
A comparison of the dateof publication of the treatise on “Naïve and Sentimental Poetry” withthe date of composition of Schlegel’s early writings would seem toshow that some of Schlegel’s distinctions, though closely related tothose of Schiller, do not derive from them so immediately as Goetheseems to imply.
67 Both sets of views grow rather inevitably outof a primitivistic or Rousseauistic conception of “nature” that hadbeen epidemic in Germany ever since the Age of Genius.
We need alsoto keep in mind certain personal traits of Schlegel if we are tounderstand the development of his theories about literature and art.
He was romantic, not only by his genius for confusion, but also oneshould add, by his tendency to oscillate violently between extremes.
For him as for Rousseau there was “no intermediary term betweeneverything and nothing.
One should note here another meaning thatcertain romanticists give to the word “ideal”--Hazlitt, for example,when he says that the “ideal is always to be found in extremes.
Every imaginable extreme, the extreme of reaction as well as theextreme of radicalism, goes with romanticism; every genuine mediationbetween extremes is just as surely unromantic.
Schlegel then was veryidealistic in the sense I have just defined.
Having begun as an extremepartisan of the Greeks, conceived in Schiller’s fashion as a peoplethat was at once harmonious and instinctive, he passes over abruptly tothe extreme of revolt against every form of classicism, and then afterhaving posed in works like his “Lucinde” as a heaven-storming Titanwho does not shrink at the wildest excess of emotional unrestraint,he passes over no less abruptly to Catholicism and its rigid outerdiscipline.
This last phase of Schlegel has at least this much incommon with his phase of revolt, that it carried with it a cult of theMiddle Ages.
The delicate point to determine about Friedrich Schlegeland many other romanticists is why they finally came to place theirland of heart’s desire in the Middle Ages rather than in Greece.
Intreating this question one needs to take at least a glance at themodification that Herder (whose influence on German romanticism is verygreat) gave to the primitivism of Rousseau.
Cultivate your genius,Rousseau said in substance, your ineffable difference from other men,and look back with longing to the ideal moment of this genius--the ageof childhood, when your spontaneous self was not as yet cramped byconventions or “sicklied o’er by the pale cast of thought.
Cultivateyour national genius, Herder said in substance, and look back wistfullyat the golden beginnings of your nationality when it was still naïveand “natural,” when poetry instead of being concocted painfully byindividuals was still the unconscious emanation of the folk.
Herderindeed expands primitivism along these lines into a whole philosophyof history.
The romantic notion of the origin of the epic springsout of this soil, a notion that is probably at least as remote fromthe facts as the neo-classical notion--and that is saying a greatdeal.
Any German who followed Herder in the extension that he gaveto Rousseau’s views about genius and spontaneity could not only seethe folk soul mirrored at least as naïvely in the “Nibelungenlied” asin the “Iliad,” but by becoming a mediæval enthusiast he could havethe superadded pleasure of indulging not merely personal but racialand national idiosyncrasy.
Primitivistic mediævalism is therefore animportant ingredient, especially in the case of Germany, in romanticnationalism--the type that has flourished beyond all measure duringthe past century.
Again, though one might, like Hölderlin, cherish aninfinite longing for the Greeks, the Greeks themselves, at least theGreeks of Schiller, did not experience longing; but this fact cameto be felt more and more by F.
Schlegel and other romanticists as aninferiority, showing as it did that they were content with the finite.
As for the neo-classicists who were supposed to be the followers ofthe Greeks, their case was even worse; they not only lacked aspirationand infinitude, but were sunk in artificiality, and had moreover becomeso analytical that they must perforce see things in “disconnectiondead and spiritless.
The men of the Middle Ages, on the other hand,as F.
Schlegel saw them, were superior to the neo-classicists in beingnaïve; their spontaneity and unity of feeling had not yet sufferedfrom artificiality, or been disintegrated by analysis.
68 At the sametime they were superior to the Greeks in having aspiration and thesense of the infinite.
The very irregularity of their art testified tothis infinitude.
It is not uncommon in the romantic movement thus toassume that because one has very little form one must therefore havea great deal of “soul.
F.
Schlegel so extended his definition of themediæval spirit as to make it include writers like Shakespeare andCervantes, who seemed to him to be vital and free from formalism.
Thenew nationalism was also made to turn to the profit of the Middle Ages.
Each nation in shaking off the yoke of classical imitation and gettingback to its mediæval past, was recovering what was primitive in its owngenius, was substituting what was indigenous for what was alien to it.
The person who did more than any one else to give internationalcurrency to the views of the Schlegels about classic and romantic andto their primitivistic mediævalism was Madame de Staël in her bookon Germany.
It was with special reference to Madame de Staël and herinfluence that Daunou wrote the following passage in his introductionto La Harpe, a passage that gives curious evidence of the earlyattitude of French literary conservatives towards the new school:    “One of the services that he La Harpe should render nowadays    is to fortify young people against vain and gothic doctrines    which would reduce the fine arts to childhood if they could    ever gain credit in the land of Racine and Voltaire.
La Harpe    uttered a warning against these doctrines when he discovered    the first germs of them in the books of Diderot, Mercier and    some other innovators.
Yet these writers were far from having    professed fully the barbaric or childish system which has been    taught and developed among us for a few years past; it is of    foreign origin; it had no name in our language and the name    that has been given to it is susceptible in fact of no precise    meaning.
Romanticism, for thus it is called, was imported    into our midst along with Kantism, with mysticism and other    doctrines of the same stamp which collectively might be named    obscurantism.
These are words which La Harpe was happy enough    not to hear.
He was accustomed to too much clearness in his    ideas and expression to use such words or even to understand    them.
He did not distinguish two literatures.
The literature    that nature and society have created for us and which for three    thousand years past has been established and preserved and    reproduced by masterpieces appeared to him alone worthy of a    Frenchman of the eighteenth century.
He did not foresee that it    would be reduced some day to being only a particular kind of    literature, tolerated or reproved under the name of classic,    and that its noblest productions would be put on the same level    as the formless sketches of uncultivated genius and untried    talents.
Yet more than once decadence has thus been taken for    an advance, and a retrograde movement for progress.
Art is so    difficult.
It is quicker to abandon it and to owe everything to    your genius.
Because perfection calls for austere toil you    maintain that it is contrary to nature.
This is a system that    suits at once indolence and vanity.
Is anything more needed to    make it popular, especially when it has as auxiliary an obscure    philosophy which is termed transcendent or transcendental? That    is just the way sound literature fell into decline beginning    with the end of the first century of the Christian era.
It    became extinct only to revive after a long period of darkness    and barbarism; and that is how it will fall into decline again    if great examples and sage lessons should ever lose their    authority.
The general public in England became at least vaguely aware of the newmovement with the translation of Madame de Staël’s “Germany” (1813)and A.
W.
Schlegel’s “Dramatic Art and Literature” (1815).
Byron wrotein his reply to Bowles (1821): “Schlegel and Madame de Staël haveendeavored to reduce poetry to two systems, classical and romantic.
The effect is only beginning.
The distinction between classic and romantic worked out by theSchlegels and spread abroad by Madame de Staël was, then, largelyassociated with a certain type of mediævalism.
Nevertheless one cannotinsist too strongly that the new school deserved to be called romantic,not because it was mediæval, but because it displayed a certain qualityof imagination in its mediævalism.
The longing for the Middle Ages ismerely a very frequent form of nostalgia, and nostalgia I have definedas the pursuit of pure illusion.
No doubt a man may be mediæval inhis leanings and yet very free from nostalgia.
He may, for example,prefer St.
Thomas Aquinas to any modern philosopher on grounds that arethe very reverse of romantic; and in the attitude of any particularperson towards the Middle Ages, romantic and unromantic elements maybe mingled in almost any conceivable proportion; and the same may besaid of any past epoch that one prefers to the present.
Goethe, forinstance, as has been remarked, took flight from his own reality,but he did not, like the romanticists, take flight from all reality.
The classical world in which Goethe dwelt in imagination during hislatter years, in the midst of a very unclassical environment, was tosome extent at least real, though one can discern even in the case ofGoethe the danger of a classicism that is too aloof from the hereand now.
But the mediævalist, in so far as he is romantic, does notturn to a mediæval reality from a real but distasteful present.
Hereas elsewhere his first requirement is not that his “vision” should betrue, but that it should be rich and radiant; and the more “ideal” thevision becomes in this sense, the wider the gap that opens betweenpoetry and life.
We are thus brought back to the problem of the romantic imagination or,one may term it, the eccentric imagination.
The classical imagination,I have said, is not free thus to fly off at a tangent, to wander wildin some empire of chimeras.
It has a centre, it is at work in theservice of reality.
With reference to this real centre, it is seekingto disengage what is normal and representative from the welter of theactual.
It does not evade the actual, but does select from it and seekto impose upon it something of the proportion and symmetry of themodel to which it is looking up and which it is imitating.
To say thatthe classicist (and I am speaking of the classicist at his best) getsat his reality with the aid of the imagination is but another way ofsaying that he perceives his reality only through a veil of illusion.
The creator of this type achieves work in which illusion and realityare inseparably blended, work which gives the “illusion of a higherreality.
Proportionate and decorous in this sense æsthetic romanticism can inno wise be, but it does not follow that the only art of which theRousseauist is capable is an art of idyllic dreaming.
Schiller makes aremark about Rousseau that goes very nearly to the heart of the matter:he is either, says Schiller, dwelling on the delights of nature orelse avenging her.
He is either, that is, idyllic or satirical.
NowRousseau himself says that he was not inclined to satire and in a sensethis is true.
He would have been incapable of lampooning Voltaire inthe same way that Voltaire lampooned him, though one might indeed wishto be lampooned by Voltaire rather than to be presented as Rousseauhas presented certain persons in his “Confessions.
In all that largeportion of Rousseau’s writing, however, in which he portrays thepolite society of his time and shows how colorless and corrupt it iscompared with his pastoral dream (for his “nature,” as I have said, isonly a pastoral dream) he is highly satirical.
In general, he is notrestrained, at least in the “Confessions,” from the trivial and eventhe ignoble detail by any weak regard for decorum.
At best decorumseems to him a hollow convention, at worst the “varnish of vice” andthe “mask of hypocrisy.
Every reader of the “Confessions” must bestruck by the presence, occasionally on the same page, of passagesthat look forward to Lamartine, and of other passages that seem ananticipation rather of Zola.
The passage in which Rousseau relateshow he was abruptly brought to earth from his “angelic loves”69 istypical.
In short Rousseau oscillates between an Arcadian vision thatis radiant but unreal, and a photographic and literal and often sordidreality.
He does not so use his imagination as to disengage the realfrom the welter of the actual and so achieve something that strikes onestill as nature but a selected and ennobled nature.
70 “It is a veryodd circumstance,” says Rousseau, “that my imagination is never moreagreeably active than when my outer conditions are the least agreeable,and that, on the contrary, it is less cheerful when everything ischeerful about me.
My poor head cannot subordinate itself to things.
Itcannot embellish, it wishes to create.
Real objects are reflected init at best such as they are; it can adorn only imaginary objects.
If Iwish to paint the springtime I must be in winter,” etc.
This passage may be said to foreshadow the two types of art andliterature that have been prevalent since Rousseau--romantic art andthe so-called realistic art that tended to supplant it towards themiddle of the nineteenth century.
71 This so-called realism does notrepresent any fundamental change of direction as compared with theearlier romanticism; it is simply, as some one has put it, romanticismgoing on all fours.
The extreme of romantic unreality has always tendedto produce a sharp recoil.
As the result of the wandering of theimagination in its own realm of chimeras, one finally comes to feelthe need of refreshing one’s sense of fact; and the more trivial thefact, the more certain one is that one’s feet are once more plantedon terra firma.
Don Quixote is working for the triumph of SanchoPanza.
Besides this tendency of one extreme to produce the other,there are special reasons that I shall point out more fully later forthe close relationship of the romanticism and the so-called realismof the nineteenth century.
They are both merely different aspects ofnaturalism.
What binds together realism and romanticism is theircommon repudiation of decorum as something external and artificial.
Once get rid of decorum, or what amounts to the same thing, thewhole body of “artificial” conventions, and what will result is,according to the romanticist, Arcadia.
But what actually emerges withthe progressive weakening of the principle of restraint is la bêtehumaine.
The Rousseauist begins by walking through the world as thoughit were an enchanted garden, and then with the inevitable clash betweenhis ideal and the real he becomes morose and embittered.
Since menhave turned out not to be indiscriminately good he inclines to lookupon them as indiscriminately bad and to portray them as such.
Atthe bottom of much so-called realism therefore is a special type ofsatire, a satire that is the product of violent emotional disillusion.
The collapse of the Revolution of 1848 produced a plentiful crop ofdisillusion of this kind.
No men had ever been more convinced of theloftiness of their idealism than the Utopists of this period, or failedmore ignominiously when put to the test.
All that remained, manyargued, was to turn from an ideal that had proved so disappointingto the real, and instead of dreaming about human nature to observemen as coolly, in Flaubert’s phrase, as though they were mastodons orcrocodiles.
But what lurks most often behind this pretence to a coldscientific impassiveness in observing human nature is a soured andcynical emotionalism and a distinctly romantic type of imagination.
Theimagination is still idealistic, still straining, that is, away fromthe real, only its idealism has undergone a strange inversion; insteadof exaggerating the loveliness it exaggerates the ugliness of humannature; it finds a sort of morose satisfaction in building for itselfnot castles but dungeons in Spain.
What I am saying applies especiallyto the French realists who are more logical in their disillusion thanthe men of other nations.
They often establish the material environmentof their heroes with photographic literalness, but in their dealingswith what should be the specifically human side of these charactersthey often resemble Rousseau at his worst: they put pure logic into theservice of pure emotion, and this is a way of achieving, not the real,but a maximum of unreality.
The so-called realistic writers abound inextreme examples of the romantic imagination.
The peasants of Zolaare not real, they are an hallucination.
If a man is thus to let hisimagination run riot, he might, as Lemaître complains, have imaginedsomething more agreeable.
The same kinship between realism and romanticism might be brought outin a writer whom Zola claimed as his master--Balzac.
I do not referto the side of Balzac that is related to what the French call lebas romantisme--his lapses into the weird and the melodramatic, hisoccasional suggestions of the claptrap of Anne Radcliffe and the Gothicromance--but to his general thesis and his handling of it.
Balzac’sattitude towards the society of his time is, like the attitude ofRousseau towards the society of his time, satirical, but on entirelydifferent grounds: he would show the havoc wrought in this societyby its revolutionary emancipation from central control of the kindthat had been provided traditionally by the monarchy and the CatholicChurch, and the consequent disruption of the family by the violent andegoistic expansion of the individual along the lines of his rulingpassion.
But Balzac’s imagination is not on the side of his thesis;not, that is, on the side of the principle of control; on the contrary,it revels in its vision of a world in which men are overstepping allethical bounds in their quest of power and pleasure, of a purelynaturalistic world that is governed solely by the law of cunning andthe law of force.
His imagination is so fascinated by this vision that,like the imagination of Rousseau, though in an entirely different way,he simply parts company with reality.
Judged by the ultimate quality ofhis imagination, and this, let me repeat, is always the chief thing toconsider in a creative artist, Balzac is a sort of inverted idealist.
Compared with the black fictions he conjures up in his painting ofParis, the actual Paris seems pale and insipid.
His Paris is not realin short, but an hallucination--a lurid land of heart’s desire.
AsLeslie Stephen puts it, for Balzac Paris is hell, but then hell is theonly place worth living in.
The empire of chimeras over which he holdssway is about as far on one side of reality as George Sand’s kingdom ofdreams is on the other.
George Sand, more perhaps than any other writerof her time, continues Rousseau in his purely idyllic manner.
Heridealized peasants are not any further from the truth and are certainlymore agreeable than the peasants of Balzac, who foreshadow the peasantsof Zola.
The writer, however, who shows the conflict between the romanticimagination and the real better than either Balzac or Zola, betterthan any other writer perhaps of the modern French movement, isFlaubert.
The fondness of this founder of realism for reality may beinferred from a passage in one of his letters to George Sand: “Ihad in my very youth a complete presentiment of life.
It was like asickly kitchen smell escaping from a basement window.
In his attitudetowards the society of his time, he is, in the same sense, but ina far greater degree than Rousseau, satirical.
The stupidity andmediocrity of the bourgeois are his target, just as Rousseau’s targetis the artificiality of the drawing-room.
At the same time that heshrinks back with nausea from this reality, Flaubert is like Gautier“full of nostalgias,” even the nostalgia of the Middle Ages.
I am aCatholic,” he exclaims, “I have in my heart something of the greenooze of the Norman Cathedrals.
Yet he cannot acquiesce in a mediævalor any other dream.
Even Rousseau says that he was “tormented at timesby the nothingness of his chimeras.
Flaubert was tormented far moreby the nothingness of his.
Perhaps indeed the predominant flavor inFlaubert’s writing as a whole is that of an acrid disillusion.
Heportrays satirically the real and at the same time mocks at the idealthat he craves emotionally and imaginatively (this is only one of theinnumerable forms assumed by the Rousseauistic warfare between the headand the heart).
He oscillates rapidly between the pole of realism ashe conceives it, and the pole of romance, and so far as any seriousphilosophy is concerned, is left suspended in the void.
Madame Bovaryis the very type of the Rousseauistic idealist, misunderstood in virtueof her exquisite faculty of feeling.
She aspires to a “love beyondall loves,” an infinite satisfaction that her commonplace husband andenvironment quite deny her.
At bottom Flaubert’s heart is with MadameBovary.
I am Madame Bovary,” he exclaims.
Yet he exposes pitilesslythe “nothingness of her chimeras,” and pursues her to the very dregsof her disillusion.
I have already mentioned Flaubert’s cult for“Don Quixote.
His intellectual origins were all there, he says; hehad known it by heart even when a boy.
It has been said that “MadameBovary” bears the same relationship to æsthetic romanticism that “DonQuixote” does to the romanticism of actual adventure of the MiddleAges.
Yet “Don Quixote” is the most genial, “Madame Bovary” the leastgenial of masterpieces.
This difference comes out no less clearly ina comparison of M.
Homais with Sancho Panza than in a comparison ofMadame Bovary with the Knight, and is so fundamental as to throw doubton the soundness of the whole analogy.
In M.
Homais and like figures Flaubert simply means to symbolizecontemporary life and the immeasurable abyss of platitude in whichit is losing itself through its lack of imagination and ideal.
Yetthis same platitude exercises on him a horrid fascination.
For hisexecration of the philistine is the nearest approach in his idealism toa positive content, to an escape from sheer emptiness and unreality.
This execration must therefore be cherished if he is to remainconvinced of his own superiority.
If it were not for my indignation,”he confesses in one place, “I should fall flat.
Unfortunately we cometo resemble what we habitually contemplate.
By dint of railing atidiots,” says Flaubert, “one runs the risk of becoming idiotic one’sself.
In his discourse on the “Immortality of the Soul” (1659) Henry Morespeaks of “that imagination which is most free, such as we use inromantic inventions.
The price that the romantic imagination paysfor its freedom should by this time be obvious: the freer it becomesthe farther it gets away from reality.
We have seen that the specialform of unreality encouraged by the æsthetic romanticism of Rousseauis the dream of the simple life, the return to a nature that neverexisted, and that this dream made its special appeal to an age thatwas suffering from an excess of artificiality and conventionalism.
Before entering upon the next stage of our subject it might be well toconsider for a moment wherein the facts of primitive life, so far aswe can ascertain them, differ from Rousseau’s dream of primitive life;why we are justified in assuming that the noble savage of Rousseau, orthe Greek of Schiller, or Hölderlin, or the man of the Middle Ages ofNovalis never had any equivalent in reality.
More or less primitive menhave existed and still exist and have been carefully studied.
Some ofthem actually recall by various traits, their gentleness, for example,Rousseau’s aboriginal man, and the natural pity that is supposed toguide him.
Why then will any one familiar with the facts of aboriginallife smile when Rousseau speaks of the savage “attached to no place,having no prescribed task, obeying no one, having no other law than hisown will,”72 and therefore displaying independence and initiative?The answer is of course that genuine savages are, with the possibleexception of children, the most conventional and imitative of beings.
What one takes to be natural in them is often the result of a long and,in the Rousseauistic sense, artificial discipline.
The tendency totake for pure and unspoiled nature what is in fact a highly modifiednature is one that assumes many forms.
When you see,” says Rousseau,“in the happiest people in the world bands of peasants regulate theaffairs of state under an oak-tree and always behave sensibly, canyou keep from despising the refinements of other nations which makethemselves illustrious and miserable with so much art and mystery?”Rousseau is viewing these peasants through the Arcadian glamour.
Inmuch the same way Emerson saw a proof of the consonance of democracywith human nature in the working of the New England town-meeting.
Butboth Rousseau’s Swiss and Emerson’s New Englanders had been moulded bygenerations of austere religious discipline and so throw little lighton the relation of democracy to human nature in itself.
A somewhat similar illusion is that of the man who journeys into afar country and enjoys in the highest degree the sense of romanticstrangeness.
He has escaped from the convention of his own society andis inclined to look on the men and women he meets in the foreign landas Arcadian apparitions.
But these men and women have not escaped fromtheir convention.
On the contrary, what most delights him in them(for example, what most delighted Lafcadio Hearn in the Japanese) maybe the result of an extraordinarily minute and tyrannical disciplineimposed in the name of the general sense upon the impulses of theindividual.
The relation of convention to primitive life is so well understoodnowadays that the Rousseauist has reversed his argument.
Sinceprimitive folk (let us say the Bushmen of Australia) are moreconventional than the Parisian and Londoner we may infer that at sometime in the future when the ideal is at last achieved upon earth,conventions will have disappeared entirely.
But this is simply totransfer the Golden Age from the past to the future, and also to missthe real problem: for there is a real problem--perhaps indeed thegravest of all problems--involved in the relation of the individual toconvention.
If we are to grasp the nature of this problem we shouldperceive first of all that the significant contrast is not that betweenconditions more or less primitive and civilization, but that between acivilization that does not question its conventions and a civilizationthat has on the contrary grown self-conscious and critical.
Thus theHomeric Greeks, set up by Schiller as exemplars of the simple life,were plainly subject to the conventions of an advanced civilization.
The Periclean Greeks were also highly civilized, but unlike the HomericGreeks, were becoming self-conscious and critical.
In the same waythe European thirteenth century, in some respects the most civilizedthat the world has seen, was governed by a great convention thatimposed very strict limits upon the liberty of the individual.
Thecritical spirit was already awake and tugging at the leashes of theouter authority that confined it, but it did not actually break them.
Dante and St.
Thomas Aquinas did not, for example, inquire into thebasis of the mediæval convention in the same way that Socrates and thesophists inquired into the traditional opinions of Greece.
But in theeighteenth century, especially in France, and from that time down tothe present day, the revolt against convention has assumed proportionsquite comparable to anything that took place in ancient Greece.
Perhapsno other age has witnessed so many individuals who were, like Berlioz,eager to make all traditional barriers crack in the interest of their“genius” and its full expression.
The state of nature in the name ofwhich Rousseau himself assailed convention, though in itself only achimera, a mere Arcadian projection upon the void, did indeed tend in arationalistic pseudo-classic age, to new forms of imaginative activity.
In the form that concerns us especially the imagination is free to giveits magic and glamour and infinitude to the emancipated emotions.
Thistype of romanticism did not result in any recovery of the supposedprimitive virtues, but it did bring about a revaluation of the receivednotions of morality that can scarcely be studied too carefully.
CHAPTER IVROMANTIC MORALITY: THE IDEALThe period that began in the late eighteenth century and in the midstof which we are still living has witnessed an almost unparalleledtriumph, as I have just said, of the sense of the individual (senspropre) over the general sense of mankind (sens commun).
Eventhe collectivistic schemes that have been opposed to individualismduring this period are themselves, judged by traditional standards,violently individualistic.
Now the word individualism needs as muchas any other general term to be treated Socratically: we need in theinterests of our present subject to discriminate between differentvarieties of individualism.
Perhaps as good a working classificationas any is to distinguish three main varieties: a man may wish to act,or think, or feel, differently from other men, and those who areindividualistic in any one of these three main ways may have verylittle in common with one another.
To illustrate concretely, Milton’splea in his “Areopagitica” for freedom of conscience makes above allfor individualism of action.
La foi qui n’agit pas est-ce une foisincère?) Pierre Bayle, on the other hand, pleads in his Dictionaryand elsewhere for tolerance, not so much because he wishes to act orfeel in his own way as because he wishes to think his own thoughts.
Rousseau is no less obviously ready to subordinate both thought andaction to sensibility.
His message is summed up once for all in theexclamation of Faust, “Feeling is all.
He urges war on the generalsense only because of the restrictions it imposes on the free expansionof his emotions and the enhancing of these emotions by his imagination.
Now the warfare that Rousseau and the individualists of feeling havewaged on the general sense has meant in practice a warfare on two greattraditions, the classical and the Christian.
I have already pointed outthat these two traditions, though both holding the idea of imitation,were not entirely in accord with one another, that the imitation ofHorace differs widely from the imitation of Christ.
Yet their divergingfrom one another is as nothing compared with their divergence fromthe individualism of the primitivist.
For the man who imitates Christin any traditional sense this world is not an Arcadian dream but aplace of trial and probation.
Take up your cross and follow me.
Thefollowing of this great exemplar required that the instinctive self,which Rousseau would indulge, should be either sternly rebuked or elsemortified utterly.
So far from Nature and God being one, the naturalman is so corrupt, according to the more austere Christian, that thegap between him and the divine can be traversed only by a miracle ofgrace.
He should therefore live in fear and trembling as befits a beingupon whom rests the weight of the divine displeasure.
It is an humblething to be a man.
Humility indeed is, in the phrase of Jeremy Taylor,the special ornament and jewel of the Christian religion, and one istempted to add, of all religion in so far as it is genuine.
Genuinereligion must always have in some form the sense of a deep inner cleftbetween man’s ordinary self and the divine.
But some Christians weremore inclined from the start, as we can see in the extreme forms ofthe doctrine of grace, to push their humility to an utter despair ofhuman nature.
The historical explanation of this despair is obvious:it is a sharp rebound from the pagan riot; an excessive immersion inthis world led to an excess of otherworldliness.
At the same timethe conviction as to man’s helplessness was instilled into those,who, like St.
Augustine, had witnessed in some of its phases the slowdisintegration of the Roman Empire.
Human nature had gone bankrupt;and for centuries it needed to be administered, if I may continue themetaphor, in receivership.
The doctrine of grace was admirably adaptedto this end.
The pagan riot from which the church reacted so sharply, was not,however, the whole of the ancient civilization.
I have already saidthat there was at the heart of this civilization at its best a greatidea--the idea of proportionateness.
The ancients were in shortnot merely naturalistic but humanistic, and the idea of proportionis just as fundamental in humanism as is humility in religion.
Christianity, one scarcely need add, incorporated within itself,however disdainfully, many humanistic elements from Greek and Romanculture.
Yet it is none the less true that in his horror at the paganworldliness the Christian tended to fly into the opposite extreme ofunworldliness, and in this clash between naturalism and supernaturalismthe purely human virtues of mediation were thrust more or less into thebackground.
Yet by its very defect on the humanistic side the doctrineof grace was perhaps all the better fitted for the administration ofhuman nature in receivership.
For thus to make man entirely distrustfulof himself and entirely dependent on God, meant in practice to makehim entirely dependent on the Church.
Man became ignorant and fanaticalin the early Christian centuries, but he also became humble, andin the situation then existing that was after all the main thing.
The Church as receiver for human nature was thus enabled to rescuecivilization from the wreck of pagan antiquity and the welter of thebarbarian invasions.
But by the very fact that the bases of life inthis world gradually grew more secure man became less otherworldly.
He gradually recovered some degree of confidence in himself.
He gaveincreasing attention to that side of himself that the ascetic Christianhad repressed.
The achievements of the thirteenth century which markperhaps the culmination of Christian civilization were very splendidnot only from a religious but also from a humanistic point of view.
Butalthough the critical spirit was already beginning to awake, it didnot at that time, as I have already said, actually break away from thetutelage of the Church.
This emancipation of human nature from theological restraint took placein far greater measure at the Renaissance.
Human nature showed itselftired of being treated as a bankrupt, of being governed from withoutand from above.
It aspired to become autonomous.
There was in so fara strong trend in many quarters towards individualism.
This rupturewith external authority meant very diverse things in practice.
Forsome who, in Lionardo’s phrase, had caught a glimpse of the antiquesymmetry it meant a revival of genuine humanism; for others it meantrather a revival of the pagan and naturalistic side of antiquity.
ThusRabelais, in his extreme opposition to the monkish ideal, alreadyproclaims, like Rousseau, the intrinsic excellence of man, whileCalvin and others attempted to revive the primitive austerity ofChristianity that had been corrupted by the formalism of Rome.
Inshort, naturalistic, humanistic, and religious elements are mingled inalmost every conceivable proportion in the vast and complex movementknown as the Renaissance; all these elements indeed are often mingledin the same individual.
The later Renaissance finally arrived at whatone is tempted to call the Jesuitical compromise.
There was a generalrevamping of dogma and outer authority, helped forward by a societythat had taken alarm at the excesses of the emancipated individual.
If the individual consented to surrender his moral autonomy, theChurch for its part consented to make religion comparatively easy andpleasant for him, to adapt it by casuistry and other devices to a humannature that was determined once for all to take a less severe andascetic view of life.
One might thus live inwardly to a great extenton the naturalistic level while outwardly going through the motionsof a profound piety.
There is an unmistakable analogy between thehollowness of a religion of this type and the hollowness that one feelsin so much neo-classical decorum.
There is also a formalistic taintin the educational system worked out by the Jesuits--a system in allrespects so ingenious and in some respects so admirable.
The Greek andespecially the Latin classics are taught in such a way as to becomeliterary playthings rather than the basis of a philosophy of life; ahumanism is thus encouraged that is external and rhetorical rather thanvital, and this humanism is combined with a religion that tends tostress submission to outer authority at the expense of inwardness andindividuality.
The reproach has been brought against this system thatit is equally unfitted to form a pagan hero or a Christian saint.
Thereply to it was Rousseau’s educational naturalism--his exaltation ofthe spontaneity and genius of the child.
Voltaire says that every Protestant is a Pope when he has his Biblein his hand.
But in practice Protestantism has been very far fromencouraging so complete a subordination of the general sense to thesense of the individual.
In the period that elapsed between the firstforward push of individualism in the Renaissance and the second forwardpush in the eighteenth century, each important Protestant group workedout its creed or convention and knew how to make it very uncomfortablefor any one of its members who rebelled against its authority.
Protestant education was also, like that of the Jesuits, an attempt toharmonize Christian and classical elements.
I have already spoken elsewhere of what was menacing all theseattempts, Protestant as well as Catholic, to revive the principleof authority, to put the general sense once more on a traditionaland dogmatic basis and impose it on the sense of the individual.
Thespirit of free scientific enquiry in the Renaissance had inspired greatnaturalists like Kepler and Galileo, and had had its prophet in Bacon.
So far from suffering any setback in the seventeenth century, sciencehad been adding conquest to conquest.
The inordinate self-confidenceof the modern man would seem to be in large measure an outcome of thissteady advance of scientific discovery, just as surely as the opposite,the extreme humility that appears in the doctrine of grace, reflectsthe despair of those who had witnessed the disintegration of theRoman Empire.
The word humility, if used at all nowadays, means thatone has a mean opinion of one’s self in comparison with other men, andnot that one perceives the weakness and nothingness of human nature initself in comparison with what is above it.
But it is not merely theself-confidence inspired by science that has undermined the traditionaldisciplines, humanistic and religious, and the attempts to mediatebetween them on a traditional basis; it is not merely that sciencehas fascinated man’s imagination, stimulated his wonder and curiositybeyond all bounds and drawn him away from the study of his own natureand its special problems to the study of the physical realm.
What hasbeen even more decisive in the overthrow of the traditional disciplinesis that science has won its triumphs not by accepting dogma andtradition but by repudiating them, by dealing with the natural law, noton a traditional but on a positive and critical basis.
The next stepthat might logically have been taken, one might suppose, would havebeen to put the human law likewise on a positive and critical basis.
Onthe contrary the very notion that man is subject to two laws has beenobscured.
The truths of humanism and religion, being very much boundup with certain traditional forms, have been rejected along with theseforms as obsolescent prejudice, and the attempt has been made to treatman as entirely the creature of the natural law.
This means in practicethat instead of dying to his ordinary self, as the austere Christiandemands, or instead of imposing a law of decorum upon his ordinaryself, as the humanist demands, man has only to develop his ordinaryself freely.
At the beginning, then, of the slow process that I have been tracingdown in briefest outline from mediæval Christianity, we find a puresupernaturalism; at the end, a pure naturalism.
If we are to understandthe relationship of this naturalism to the rise of a romantic morality,we need to go back, as we have done in our study of original genius,to the England of the early eighteenth century.
Perhaps the mostimportant intermediary stage in the passage from a pure supernaturalismto a pure naturalism is the great deistic movement which flourishedespecially in the England of this period.
Deism indeed is no newthing.
Deistic elements may be found even in the philosophy of theMiddle Ages.
But for practical purposes one does not need in one’sstudy of deism to go behind English thinkers like Shaftesbury and hisfollower Hutcheson.
Shaftesbury is a singularly significant figure.
He is not only the authentic precursor of innumerable naturalisticmoralists in England, France, and Germany, but one may also tracein his writings the connection between modern naturalistic moralityand ancient naturalistic morality in its two main forms--Stoic andEpicurean.
The strict Christian supernaturalist had maintained that thedivine can be known to man only by the outer miracle of revelation,supplemented by the inner miracle of grace.
The deist maintains, onthe contrary, that God reveals himself also through outer nature whichhe has fitted exquisitely to the needs of man, and that inwardly manmay be guided aright by his unaided thoughts and feelings (accordingto the predominance of thought or feeling the deist is rationalisticor sentimental).
Man, in short, is naturally good and nature herselfis beneficent and beautiful.
The deist finally pushes this harmony inGod and man and nature so far that the three are practically merged.
At a still more advanced stage God disappears, leaving only natureand man as a modification of nature, and the deist gives way to thepantheist who may also be either rationalistic or emotional.
Thepantheist differs above all from the deist in that he would dethroneman from his privileged place in creation, which means in practice thathe denies final causes.
He no longer believes, for example, like thatsentimental deist and disciple of Rousseau, Bernardin de St.
Pierre,that Providence has arranged everything in nature with an immediate eyeto man’s welfare; that the markings on the melon, for instance, “seemto show that it is destined for the family table.
73Rousseau himself, though eschewing this crude appeal to final causes,scarcely got in theory at least beyond the stage of emotional deism.
The process I have been describing is illustrated better in someaspects by Diderot who began as a translator of Shaftesbury and wholater got so far beyond mere deism that he anticipates the main ideasof the modern evolutionist and determinist.
Diderot is at once anavowed disciple of Bacon, a scientific utilitarian in short, and alsoa believer in the emancipation of the emotions.
Rousseau’s attackon science is profoundly significant for other reasons, but it isunfortunate in that it obscures the connection that is so visible inDiderot between the two sides of the naturalistic movement.
If men hadnot been so heartened by scientific progress they would have been lessready, we may be sure, to listen to Rousseau when he affirmed that theywere naturally good.
There was another reason why men were eager tobe told that they were naturally good and that they could thereforetrust the spontaneous overflow of their emotions.
This reason is to besought in the inevitable recoil from the opposite doctrine of totaldepravity and the mortal constraint that it had put on the instincts ofthe natural man.
I have said that many churchmen, notably the Jesuits,sought to dissimulate the full austerity of Christian doctrine andthus retain their authority over a world that was moving away fromausterity and so threatening to escape them.
But other Catholics,notably the Jansenists, as well as Protestants like the Calvinists,were for insisting to the full on man’s corruption and for seeking tomaintain on this basis what one is tempted to call a theological reignof terror.
One whole side of Rousseau’s religion can be understoodonly as a protest against the type of Christianity that is found in aPascal or a Jonathan Edwards.
The legend of the abyss that Pascal sawalways yawning at his side has at least a symbolical value.
It is thewont of man to oscillate violently between extremes, and each extremeis not only bad in itself but even worse by the opposite extreme thatit engenders.
From a God who is altogether fearful, men are ready toflee to a God who is altogether loving, or it might be more correct tosay altogether lovely.
Listen, my children,” said Mother Angélique ofPort-Royal to her nuns a few hours before her death, “listen well towhat I say.
Most people do not know what death is, and never give thematter a thought.
But my worst forebodings were as nothing comparedwith the terrors now upon me.
In deliberate opposition to suchexpressions of the theological terror, Rousseau imagined the elaboratecomplacency and self-satisfaction of the dying Julie, whose end wasnot only calm but æsthetic (le dernier jour de sa vie en fut aussi leplus charmant).
A sensible member of Edwards’s congregation at Northampton mightconceivably have voted with the majority to dismiss him, not onlybecause he objected to this spiritual terrorism in itself, butalso because he saw the opposite extreme that it would help toprecipitate--the boundless sycophancy of human nature from which we arenow suffering.
The effusiveness, then, that began to appear in the eighteenth centuryis one sign of the progress of naturalism, which is itself due tothe new confidence inspired in man by scientific discovery coupledwith a revulsion from the austerity of Christian dogma.
This neweffusiveness is also no less palpably a revulsion from the excess ofartificial decorum and this revulsion was in turn greatly promoted bythe rapid increase in power and influence at this time of the middleclass.
Reserve is traditionally aristocratic.
The plebeian is no lesstraditionally expansive.
It cannot be said that the decorous reserveof the French aristocracy that had been more or less imitated by otherEuropean aristocracies was in all respects commendable.
According tothis decorum a man should not love his wife, or if he did, should becareful not to betray the fact in public.
It was also good “form”to live apart from one’s children and bad form to display one’saffection for them.
The protest against a decorum that repressed eventhe domestic emotions may perhaps best be followed in the rise of themiddle class drama.
According to strict neo-classic decorum only thearistocracy had the right to appear in tragedy, whereas the man of themiddle class was relegated to comedy and the man of the people tofarce.
The intermediate types of play that multiply in the eighteenthcentury (drame bourgeois, comédie larmoyante, etc.
are the replyof the plebeian to this classification.
He is beginning to insist thathis emotions too shall be taken seriously.
But at the same time he is,under the influence of the new naturalistic philosophy, so bent onaffirming his own goodness that in getting rid of artificial decorumhe gets rid of true decorum likewise and so strikes at the very rootof the drama.
For true drama in contradistinction to mere melodramarequires in the background a scale of ethical values, or what amountsto the same thing, a sense of what is normal and representative anddecorous, and the quality of the characters is revealed by theirresponsible choices good or bad with reference to some ethical scale,choices that the characters reveal by their actions and not by anyexplicit moralizing.
But in the middle class drama there is littleaction in this sense: no one wills either his goodness or badness,but appears more or less as the creature of accident or fate (in a veryun-Greek sense), or of a defective social order; and so instead oftrue dramatic conflict and proper motivation one tends to get domestictableaux in which the characters weep in unison.
For it is understoodnot only that man (especially the bourgeois) is good but that theorthodox way for this goodness to manifest itself is to overflowthrough the eyes.
Perhaps never before or since have tears been shedwith such a strange facility.
At no other time have there been so manypersons who, with streaming eyes, called upon heaven and earth to bearwitness to their innate excellence.
A man would be ashamed, says LaBruyère, speaking from the point of view of l’honnête homme andhis decorum, to display his emotions at the theatre.
By the time ofDiderot he would have been ashamed not to display them.
It had becomealmost a requirement of good manners to weep and sob in public.
At theperformance of the “Père de Famille” in 1769 we are told that everyhandkerchief was in use.
The Revolution seems to have raised doubts asto the necessary connection between tearfulness and goodness.
The “Pèrede Famille” was hissed from the stage in 1811.
Geoffroy commented inhis feuilleton: “We have learned by a fatal experience that forty yearsof declamation and fustian about sensibility, humanity and benevolence,have served only to prepare men’s hearts for the last excesses ofbarbarism.
The romanticist indulged in the luxury of grief and was not incapableof striking an attitude.
But as a rule he disdained the facilelachrymosity of the man of feeling as still too imitative andconventional.
For his part, he has that within which passes show.
Toestimate a play solely by its power to draw tears is, as Coleridgeobserves, to measure it by a virtue that it possesses in common withthe onion; and Chateaubriand makes a similar observation.
Yet oneshould not forget that the romantic emotionalist derives directly fromthe man of feeling.
One may indeed study the transition from the oneto the other in Chateaubriand himself.
For example, in his early workthe “Natchez” he introduces a tribe of Sioux Indians who are stillgoverned by the natural pity of Rousseau, as they prove by weeping onthe slightest occasion.
Lamartine again is close to Rousseau when heexpatiates on the “genius” that is to be found in a tear; and Mussetis not far from Diderot when he exclaims, “Long live the melodrama atwhich Margot wept” (Vive le mélodrame où Margot a pleuré).
Though it is usual to associate this effusiveness with Rousseau itshould be clear from my brief sketch of the rise of the forces thatwere destined to overthrow the two great traditions--the Christiantradition with its prime emphasis on humility and the classical withits prime emphasis on decorum--that Rousseau had many forerunners.
Itwould be easy enough, for example, to cite from English literatureof the early eighteenth-century domestic tableaux74 that lookforward equally to the middle class drama and to Rousseau’s pictureof the virtues of Julie as wife and mother.
Yet Rousseau, after all,deserves his preëminent position as the arch-sentimentalist by thevery audacity of his revolt in the name of feeling from both humilityand decorum.
Never before and probably never since has a man of suchundoubted genius shown himself so lacking in humility and decency(to use the old-fashioned synonym for decorum) as Rousseau in the“Confessions.
Rousseau feels himself so good that he is ready as hedeclares to appear before the Almighty at the sound of the trump ofthe last judgment, with the book of his “Confessions” in his hand,and there to issue a challenge to the whole human race: “Let a singleone assert to Thee if he dare: I am better than that man.
As HoraceWalpole complains he meditates a gasconade for the end of the world.
It is possible to maintain with M.
Lemaître that Rousseau’s characterunderwent a certain purification as he grew older, but never at anytime, either at the beginning or at the end, is it possible, as M.
Lemaître admits, to detect an atom of humility--an essential lack thathad already been noted by Burke.
The affront then that Rousseau puts upon humility at the very openingof his “Confessions” has like so much else in his life and writingsa symbolical value.
He also declares war in the same passage in thename of what he conceives to be his true self--that is his emotionalself--against decorum or decency.
I have already spoken of one ofthe main objections to decorum: it keeps one tame and conventionaland interferes with the explosion of original genius.
Another andclosely allied grievance against decorum is implied in Rousseau’sopening assertion in the Confessions that his aim is to show a manin all the truth of his nature, and human nature can be known inits truth only, it should seem, when stripped of its last shred ofreticence.
Rousseau therefore already goes on the principle recentlyproclaimed by the Irish Bohemian George Moore, that the only thing aman should be ashamed of is of being ashamed.
If the first objection todecorum--that it represses original genius--was urged especially by theromanticists, the second objection--that decorum interferes with truthto nature--was urged especially by the so-called realists of the laternineteenth century (and realism of this type is, as has been said, onlyromanticism going on all fours).
Between the Rousseauistic conceptionof nature and that of the humanist the gap is especially wide.
Thehumanist maintains that man attains to the truth of his nature only byimposing decorum upon his ordinary self.
The Rousseauist maintains thatman attains to this truth only by the free expansion of his ordinaryself.
The humanist fears to let his ordinary self unfold freely at theexpense of decorum lest he merit some such comment as that made onthe “Confessions” by Madame de Boufflers who had been infatuated withRousseau during his lifetime: that it was the work not of a man but ofan unclean animal.
75The passages of the “Confessions” that deserve this verdict do not, itis hardly necessary to add, reflect directly Rousseau’s moral ideal.
In his dealings with morality as elsewhere he is, to come back toSchiller’s distinction, partly idyllic and partly satirical.
He issatiric in his attitude towards the existing forms--forms based uponthe Christian tradition that man is naturally sinful and that he needstherefore the discipline of fear and humility, or else forms based uponthe classical tradition that man is naturally one-sided and that heneeds therefore to be disciplined into decorum and proportionateness.
He is idyllic in the substitutes that he would offer for thesetraditional forms.
The substitutes are particularly striking in theirrefusal to allow any place for fear.
Fear, according to Ovid, createdthe first Gods, and religion has been defined by an old English poetas the “mother of form and fear.
Rousseau would put in the place ofform a fluid emotionalism, and as for fear, he would simply cast itout entirely, a revulsion, as I have pointed out, from the excessiveemphasis on fear in the more austere forms of Christianity.
Be“natural,” Rousseau says, and eschew priests and doctors, and you willbe emancipated from fear.
Rousseau’s expedient for getting rid of man’s sense of his ownsinfulness on which fear and humility ultimately rest is well known.
Evil, says Rousseau, foreign to man’s constitution, is introduced intoit from without.
The burden of guilt is thus conveniently shifted uponsociety.
Instead of the old dualism between good and evil in the breastof the individual, a new dualism is thus set up between an artificialand corrupt society and “nature.
For man, let me repeat, has,according to Rousseau, fallen from nature in somewhat the same way asin the old theology he fell from God, and it is here that the idyllicelement comes in, for, let us remind ourselves once more, Rousseau’snature from which man has fallen is only an Arcadian dream.
The assertion of man’s natural goodness is plainly something veryfundamental in Rousseau, but there is something still more fundamental,and that is the shifting of dualism itself, the virtual denial of astruggle between good and evil in the breast of the individual.
Thatdeep inner cleft in man’s being on which religion has always put somuch emphasis is not genuine.
Only get away from an artificial societyand back to nature and the inner conflict which is but a part of theartificiality will give way to beauty and harmony.
In a passage in his“Supplément au voyage de Bougainville,” Diderot puts the underlyingthesis of the new morality almost more clearly than Rousseau: “Doyou wish to know in brief the tale of almost all our woe? There onceexisted a natural man; there has been introduced within this man anartificial man and there has arisen in the cave a civil war which laststhroughout life.
The denial of the reality of the “civil war in the cave” involves anentire transformation of the conscience.
The conscience ceases to bea power that sits in judgment on the ordinary self and inhibits itsimpulses.
It tends so far as it is recognized at all, to become itselfan instinct and an emotion.
Students of the history of ethics scarcelyneed to be told that this transformation of the conscience was led upto by the English deists, especially by Shaftesbury and his discipleHutcheson.
76 Shaftesbury and Hutcheson are already æsthetic in allsenses of the word; æsthetic in that they tend to base conduct uponfeeling, and æsthetic in that they incline to identify the good andthe beautiful.
Conscience is ceasing for both of them to be an innercheck on the impulses of the individual and becoming a moral sense, asort of expansive instinct for doing good to others.
Altruism, as thusconceived, is opposed by them to the egoism of Hobbes and his followers.
But for the full implications of this transformation of conscienceand for æsthetic morality in general one needs to turn to Rousseau.
Most men according to Rousseau are perverted by society, but thereare a few in whom the voice of “nature” is still strong and who, tobe good and at the same time beautiful, have only to let themselvesgo.
These, to use a term that came to have in the eighteenth centuryan almost technical meaning, are the “beautiful souls.
The belleâme is practically indistinguishable from the âme sensible and hasmany points in common with the original genius.
Those whose souls arebeautiful are a small transfigured band in the midst of a philistinemultitude.
They are not to be judged by the same rules as those ofless exquisite sensibility.
There are unfortunates too privileged tofollow the common pathway.
77 The beautiful soul is unintelligibleto those of coarser feelings.
His very superiority, his preternaturalfineness of sensation, thus predestines him to suffering.
We are hereat the root of romantic melancholy as will appear more fully later.
The most important aspect of the whole conception is, however, thestrictly ethical--the notion that the beautiful soul has only to beinstinctive and temperamental to merit the praise that has in the pastbeen awarded only to the purest spirituality.
As for Julie,” saysRousseau, “who never had any other guide but her heart and could haveno surer guide, she gives herself up to it without scruple, and to doright, has only to do all that it asks of her.
78 Virtue indeed,according to Rousseau, is not merely an instinct but a passion andeven a voluptuous passion, moving in the same direction as otherpassions, only superior to them in vehemence.
Cold reason has neverdone anything illustrious; and you can triumph over the passions onlyby opposing them to one another.
When the passion of virtue arises, itdominates everything and holds everything in equipoise.
79This notion of the soul that is spontaneously beautiful and thereforegood made an especial appeal to the Germans and indeed is oftenassociated with Germany more than with any other land.
80 But examplesof moral æstheticism are scarcely less frequent elsewhere fromRousseau to the present.
No one, for example, was ever more convincedof the beauty of his own soul than Renan.
Morality,” says Renan, “hasbeen conceived up to the present in a very narrow spirit, as obedienceto a law, as an inner struggle between opposite laws.
As for me, Ideclare that when I do good I obey no one, I fight no battle and win novictory.
The cultivated man has only to follow the delicious incline ofhis inner impulses.
81 Therefore, as he says elsewhere, “Be beautifuland then do at each moment whatever your heart may inspire you to do.
This is the whole of morality.
82The doctrine of the beautiful soul is at once a denial and a parodyof the doctrine of grace; a denial because it rejects original sin;a parody because it holds that the beautiful soul acts aright, notthrough any effort of its own but because nature acts in it and throughit even as a man in a state of grace acts aright not through any meritof his own but because God acts in him and through him.
The man whosaw everything from the angle of grace was, like the beautiful soul orthe original genius, inclined to look upon himself as exceptional andsuperlative.
Bunyan entitles the story of his own inner life “Graceabounding to the chief of sinners.
But Bunyan flatters himself.
Itis not easy to be chief in such a lively competition.
Humility andpride were evidently in a sort of grapple with one another in thebreast of the Jansenist who declared that God had killed three menin order to compass his salvation.
In the case of the beautiful soulthe humility disappears, but the pride remains.
He still looks uponhimself as superlative but superlative in goodness.
If all men werelike himself, Renan declares, it would be appropriate to say of them:Ye are Gods and sons of the most high.
83 The partisan of grace holdsthat works are of no avail compared with the gratuitous and unmeritedillumination from above.
The beautiful soul clings to his belief inhis own innate excellence, no matter how flagrant the contradictionmay be between this belief and his deeds.
One should not fail to notesome approximation to the point of view of the beautiful soul in thoseforms of Christianity in which the sense of sin is somewhat relaxedand the inner light very much emphasized--for example among the Germanpietists and the quietists of Catholic countries.
84 We even hear ofpersons claiming to be Christians who as the result of debauchery haveexperienced a spiritual awakening (Dans la brute assoupie, un ange seréveille).
But such doctrines are mere excrescences and eccentricitiesin the total history of Christianity.
Even in its extreme insistenceon grace, Christianity has always tended to supplement rather thancontradict the supreme maxim of humanistic morality as enunciated byCicero: “The whole praise of virtue is in action.
The usual resultof the doctrine of grace when sincerely held is to make a man feeldesperately sinful at the same time that he is less open to reproachthan other men in his actual behavior.
The beautiful soul on theother hand can always take refuge in his feelings from his realdelinquencies.
According to Joubert, Chateaubriand was not disturbedby actual lapses in his conduct because of his persuasion of his owninnate rectitude.
85 “Her conduct was reprehensible,” says Rousseauof Madame de Warens, “but her heart was pure.
It does not matterwhat you do if only through it all you preserve the sense of your ownloveliness.
Indeed the more dubious the act the more copious wouldseem to be the overflow of fine sentiments to which it stimulatesthe beautiful soul.
Rousseau dilates on his “warmth of heart,” his“keenness of sensibility,” his “innate benevolence for his fellowcreatures,” his “ardent love for the great, the true, the beautiful,the just,” on the “melting feeling, the lively and sweet emotion thathe experiences at the sight of everything that is virtuous, generousand lovely,” and concludes: “And so my third child was put into thefoundling hospital.
If we wish to see the psychology of Rousseau writ large we should turnto the French Revolution.
That period abounds in persons whose goodnessis in theory so superlative that it overflows in a love for all men,but who in practice are filled like Rousseau in his later years withuniversal suspicion.
There was indeed a moment in the Revolution whenthe madness of Rousseau became epidemic, when suspicion was pushedto such a point that men became “suspect of being suspect.
One ofthe last persons to see Rousseau alive at Ermenonville was MaximilienRobespierre.
He was probably a more thoroughgoing Rousseauist thanany other of the Revolutionary leaders.
Perhaps no passage that couldbe cited illustrates with more terrible clearness the tendency of thenew morality to convert righteousness into self-righteousness thanthe following from his last speech before the Convention at the veryheight of the Reign of Terror.
Himself devoured by suspicion, he isrepelling the suspicion that he wishes to erect his own power on theruins of the monarchy.
The idea, he says, that “he can descend to theinfamy of the throne will appear probable only to those perverse beingswho have not even the right to believe in virtue.
But why speak ofvirtue? Doubtless virtue is a natural passion.
But how could they befamiliar with it, these venal spirits who never yielded access to aughtsave cowardly and ferocious passions? … Yet virtue exists as you cantestify, feeling and pure souls; it exists, that tender, irresistible,imperious passion, torment and delight of magnanimous hearts, thatprofound horror of tyranny, that compassionate zeal for the oppressed,that sacred love for one’s country, that still more sublime andsacred love for humanity, without which a great revolution is only aglittering crime that destroys another crime; it exists, that generousambition to found on earth the first Republic of the world; that egoismof undegenerate men who find a celestial voluptuousness in the calm ofa pure conscience and the ravishing spectacle of public happiness(!).
You feel it at this moment burning in your souls.
I feel it in mine.
But how could our vile calumniators have any notion of it?” etc.
In Robespierre and other revolutionary leaders one may study theimplications of the new morality--the attempt to transform virtue intoa natural passion--not merely for the individual but for society.
M.
Rod entitled his play on Rousseau “The Reformer.
Both Rousseau and hisdisciple Robespierre were reformers in the modern sense,--that is theyare concerned not with reforming themselves, but other men.
Inasmuchas there is no conflict between good and evil in the breast of thebeautiful soul he is free to devote all his efforts to the improvementof mankind, and he proposes to achieve this great end by diffusing thespirit of brotherhood.
All the traditional forms that stand in the wayof this free emotional expansion he denounces as mere “prejudices,”and inclines to look on those who administer these forms as a gang ofconspirators who are imposing an arbitrary and artificial restraint onthe natural goodness of man and so keeping it from manifesting itself.
With the final disappearance of the prejudices of the past and thosewho base their usurped authority upon them, the Golden Age will beushered in at last; everybody will be boundlessly self-assertive andat the same time temper this self-assertion by an equally boundlesssympathy for others, whose sympathy and self-assertion likewise know nobounds.
The world of Walt Whitman will be realized, a world in whichthere is neither inferior nor superior but only comrades.
This vision(such for example as appears at the end of Shelley’s “Prometheus”) ofa humanity released from all evil artificially imposed from without,a humanity “where all things flow to all, as rivers to the sea” and“whose nature is its own divine control,” is the true religion of theRousseauist.
It is this image of a humanity glorified through lovethat he sets up for worship in the sanctuary left vacant by “the greatabsence of God.
This transformation of the Arcadian dreamer into the Utopist is duein part, as I have already suggested, to the intoxication producedin the human spirit by the conquests of science.
One can discern thecoöperation of Baconian and Rousseauist from a very early stage of thegreat humanitarian movement in the midst of which we are still living.
Both Baconian and Rousseauist are interested not in the strugglebetween good and evil in the breast of the individual, but in theprogress of mankind as a whole.
If the Rousseauist hopes to promotethe progress of society by diffusing the spirit of brotherhood theBaconian or utilitarian hopes to achieve the same end by perfectingits machinery.
It is scarcely necessary to add that these two maintypes of humanitarianism may be contained in almost any proportion inany particular person.
By his worship of man in his future materialadvance, the Baconian betrays no less surely than the Rousseauist hisfaith in man’s natural goodness.
This lack of humility is especiallyconspicuous in those who have sought to develop the positiveobservations of science into a closed system with the aid of logic andpure mathematics.
Pascal already remarked sarcastically of Descartesthat he had no need of God except to give an initial fillip to hismechanism.
Later the mechanist no longer grants the need of the initialfillip.
According to the familiar anecdote, La Place when asked byNapoleon in the course of an explanation of his “Celestial Mechanics”where God came in, replied that he had no need of a God in his system.
As illustrating the extreme of humanitarian arrogance one may takethe following from the physicist and mathematician, W.
K.
Clifford:“The dim and shadowy outlines of the superhuman deity fade slowly frombefore us; and as the mist of his presence floats aside, we perceivewith greater and greater clearness the shape of a yet grander andnobler figure--of Him who made all gods and shall unmake them.
Fromthe dim dawn of history and from the inmost depths of every soul theface of our father Man looks out upon us with the fire of eternal youthin his eyes and says, ‘Before Jehovah was, I am.
The fire, one istempted to say, of eternal lust! Clifford is reported to have once hungby his toes from the cross-bar of a weathercock on a church-tower.
Asa bit of intellectual acrobatics the passage I have just quoted hassome analogy with this posture.
Further than this, man’s intoxicationwith himself is not likely to go.
The attitude of Clifford is even moreextreme in its way than that of Jonathan Edwards in his.
However, thereare already signs that the man of science is becoming, if not humble,at least a trifle less arrogant.
One can imagine the Rousseauist interrupting at this point to remarkthat one of his chief protests has always been against the mechanicaland utilitarian and in general the scientific attitude towards life.
This is true.
Something has already been said about this protest andit will be necessary to say more about it later.
Yet Rousseauist andBaconian agree, as I have said, in turning away from the “civil war inthe cave” to humanity in the lump.
They agree in being more or lessrebellious towards the traditional forms that put prime emphasis onthe “civil war in the cave”--whether the Christian tradition with itshumility or the classical with its decorum.
No wonder Prometheus wasthe great romantic hero.
Prometheus was at once a rebel, a lover of manand a promoter of man’s material progress.
We have been living for overa century in what may be termed an age of Promethean individualism.
The Rousseauist especially feels an inner kinship with Prometheus andother Titans.
He is fascinated by every form of insurgency.
Cain andSatan are both romantic heroes.
To meet the full romantic requirement,however, the insurgent must also be tender-hearted.
He must show anelemental energy in his explosion against the established order andat the same time a boundless sympathy for the victims of it.
One ofHugo’s poems tells of a Mexican volcano, that in sheer disgust atthe cruelty of the members of the Inquisition, spits lava upon them.
This compassionate volcano symbolizes in both of its main aspectsthe romantic ideal.
Hence the enormous international popularityof Schiller’s “Robbers.
One may find innumerable variants of thebrigand Karl Moor who uses his plunder “to support meritorious youngmen at college.
The world into which we enter from the very dawn ofromanticism is one of “glorious rascals,” and “beloved vagabonds.
Sublime convicts,” says M.
Lasserre, “idlers of genius,    angelic female poisoners, monsters inspired by God, sincere    comedians, virtuous courtesans, metaphysical mountebanks,    faithful adulterers, form only one half--the sympathetic half    of humanity according to romanticism.
The other half, the    wicked half, is manufactured by the same intellectual process    under the suggestion of the same revolutionary instinct.
It comprises all those who hold or stand for a portion of    any discipline whatsoever, political, religious, moral or    intellectual--kings, ministers, priests, judges, soldiers,    policemen, husbands and critics.
86The Rousseauist is ever ready to discover beauty of soul in any onewho is under the reprobation of society.
The figure of the courtesanrehabilitated through love that has enjoyed such popularity during thepast hundred years goes back to Rousseau himself.
87 The underlyingassumption of romantic morality is that the personal virtues, thevirtues that imply self-control, count as naught compared with thefraternal spirit and the readiness to sacrifice one’s self forothers.
This is the ordinary theme of the Russian novel in whichone finds, as Lemaître remarks, “the Kalmuck exaggerations of ourFrench romantic ideas.
For example Sonia in “Crime and Punishment”is glorified because she prostitutes herself to procure a livelihoodfor her family.
One does not however need to go to Russia for what isscarcely less the assumption of contemporary America.
If it can onlybe shown that a person is sympathetic we are inclined to pardon himhis sins of unrestraint, his lack, for example, of common honesty.
As an offset to the damaging facts brought out at the investigationof the sugar trust, the defense sought to establish that the late H.
O.
Havemeyer was a beautiful soul.
It was testified that he couldnever hear little children sing without tears coming into his eyes.
His favorite song, some one was unkind enough to suggest, was “littledrops of water, little grains of sand.
The newspapers again reportednot long ago that a notorious Pittsburg grafter had petitioned forhis release from the penitentiary on the grounds that he wished tocontinue his philanthropic activities among the poor.
Another paragraphthat appeared recently in the daily press related that a burglar whileengaged professionally in a house at Los Angeles discovered that thelady of the house had a child suffering from croup, and at once came toher aid, explaining that he had six children of his own.
No one couldreally think amiss of this authentic descendant of Schiller’s KarlMoor.
For love, according to the Rousseauist, is not the fulfillmentof the law but a substitute for it.
In “Les Misérables” Hugo contrastsJavert who stands for the old order based on obedience to the lawwith the convict Jean Valjean who stands for the new regeneration ofman through love and self-sacrifice.
When Javert awakens to the fullignominy of his rôle he does the only decent thing--he commits suicide.
Hugo indeed has perhaps carried the new evangel of sympathy as asubstitute for all the other virtues further than any one else and withfewer weak concessions to common sense.
Sultan Murad, Hugo narrates,was “sublime.
He had his eight brothers strangled, caused his uncle tobe sawn in two between two planks, opened one after the other twelvechildren to find a stolen apple, shed an ocean of blood and “sabred theworld.
One day while passing in front of a butcher-shop he saw a pigbleeding to death, tormented by flies and with the sun beating uponits wound.
Touched by pity, the Sultan pushes the pig into the shadewith his foot and with an “enormous and superhuman gesture” drives awaythe flies.
When Murad dies the pig appears before the Almighty and,pleading for him against the accusing host of his victims, wins hispardon.
Moral: “A succored pig outweighs a world oppressed”88 (Unpourceau secouru vaut un monde égorgé).
This subordination of all the other values of life to sympathy isachieved only at the expense of the great humanistic virtue--decorumor a sense of proportion.
Now not to possess a sense of proportion is,however this lack may be manifested, to be a pedant; and, if there isever a humanistic reaction, Hugo, one of the chief products of the ageof original genius, will scarcely escape the charge of pedantry.
Buttrue religion also insists on a hierarchy of the virtues.
Burke speaksat least as much from a religious as from a humanistic point of viewwhen he writes:    “The greatest crimes do not arise so much from a want of    feeling for others as from an over-sensibility for ourselves    and an over-indulgence to our own desires.
They the    ‘philosophes’ explode or render odious or contemptible that    class of virtues which restrain the appetite.
These are at    least nine out of ten of the virtues.
In the place of all    this they substitute a virtue which they call humanity or    benevolence.
By these means their morality has no idea in it    of restraint or indeed of a distinct and settled principle of    any kind.
When their disciples are thus left free and guided    only by present feeling, they are no longer to be depended    on for good and evil.
The men who to-day snatch the worst    criminals from justice will murder the most innocent persons    to-morrow.
89The person who seeks to get rid of ninety per cent of the virtues infavor of an indiscriminate sympathy does not simply lose his scale ofvalues.
He arrives at an inverted scale of values.
For the higher theobject for which one feels sympathy the more the idea of obligationis likely to intrude--the very thing the Rousseauist is seeking toescape.
One is more irresponsible and therefore more spontaneous in theRousseauistic sense in lavishing one’s pity on a dying pig.
Medicalmen have given a learned name to the malady of those who neglect themembers of their own family and gush over animals (zoöphilpsychosis).
But Rousseau already exhibits this “psychosis.
He abandoned his fivechildren one after the other, but had we are told an unspeakableaffection for his dog.
90Rousseau’s contemporary, Sterne, is supposed to have lavished asomewhat disproportionate emotion upon an ass.
But the ass doesnot really come into his own until a later stage of the movement.
Nietzsche has depicted the leaders of the nineteenth century asengaged in a veritable onolatry or ass-worship.
The opposition betweenneo-classicist and Rousseauist is indeed symbolized in a fashion bytheir respective attitude towards the ass.
Neo-classical decorumwas, it should be remembered, an all-pervading principle.
It imposeda severe hierarchy, not only upon objects, but upon the words thatexpress these objects.
The first concern of the decorous person was toavoid lowness, and the ass he looked upon as hopelessly low--so lowas to be incapable of ennoblement even by a resort to periphrasis.
Homer therefore was deemed by Vida to have been guilty of outrageousindecorum in comparing Ajax to an ass.
The partisans of Homer soughtindeed to prove that the ass was in the time of Homer a “noble” animalor at least that the word ass was “noble.
But the stigma put uponHomer by Vida--reinforced as it was by the similar attacks of Scaligerand others--remained.
The rehabilitation of the ass by the Rousseauist is at once a protestagainst an unduly squeamish decorum, and a way of proclaiming the newprinciple of unbounded expansive sympathy.
In dealing with both wordsand what they express, one should show a democratic inclusiveness.
Something has already been said of the war the romanticist waged inthe name of local color against the impoverishment of vocabulary bythe neo-classicists.
But the romantic warfare against the aristocraticsqueamishness of the neo-classic vocabulary goes perhaps even deeper.
Take, for instance, Wordsworth’s view as to the proper language ofpoetry.
Poetical decorum had become by the end of the eighteenthcentury a mere varnish of conventional elegance.
Why should merepolite prejudice, so Wordsworth reasoned, and the “gaudiness and inanephraseology” in which it resulted be allowed to interfere with the“spontaneous overflow of powerful emotion”? And so he proceeds to setup a view of poetry that is only the neo-classical view turned upsidedown.
For the proper subjects and speech of poetry he would turn fromthe highest class of society to the lowest, from the aristocrat tothe peasant.
The peasant is more poetical than the aristocrat becausehe is closer to nature, for Wordsworth as he himself avows, is lessinterested in the peasant for his own sake than because he sees in hima sort of emanation of the landscape.
91One needs to keep all this background in mind if one wishes tounderstand the full significance of a poem like “Peter Bell.
Scaliger blames Homer because he stoops to mention in his descriptionof Zeus something so trivial as the eyebrows.
Wordsworth seeks tobestow poetical dignity and seriousness on the “long left ear” of anass.
92 The ass is thus exalted one scarcely need add, because ofhis compassionateness.
The hard heart of Peter Bell is at last meltedby the sight of so much goodness.
He aspires to be like the ass andfinally achieves his wish.
The French romanticists, Hugo, for instance, make an attack on decorumsomewhat similar to that of Wordsworth.
Words formerly lived, saysHugo, divided up into castes.
Some had the privilege of mounting intothe king’s coaches at Versailles, whereas others were relegated tothe rabble.
I came along and clapped a red liberty cap on the olddictionary.
I brought about a literary ’93,93 etc.
Hugo’s attackon decorum is also combined with an even more violent assertion thanWordsworth’s of the ideal of romantic morality--the supremacy of pity.
He declares in the “Legend of the Ages” that an ass that takes a stepaside to avoid crushing a toad is “holier than Socrates and greaterthan Plato.
94 For this and similar utterances Hugo deserves to beplaced very nearly if not quite at the head of romantic onolaters.
We have said that the tremendous burden put upon sympathy in romanticmorality is a result of the assumption that the “civil war in the cave”is artificial and that therefore the restraining virtues (accordingto Burke ninety per cent of the virtues) which imply this warfareare likewise artificial.
If the civil war in the cave should turnout to be not artificial but a fact of the gravest import, the wholespiritual landscape would change immediately.
Romantic morality wouldin that case be not a reality but a mirage.
We need at all events tograsp the central issue firmly.
Humanism and religion have alwaysasserted in some form or other the dualism of the human spirit.
A man’sspirituality is in inverse ratio to his immersion in temperament.
Thewhole movement from Rousseau to Bergson is, on the other hand, filledwith the glorification of instinct.
To become spiritual the beautifulsoul needs only to expand along the lines of temperament and with thisprocess the cult of pity or sympathy does not interfere.
The romanticmoralist tends to favor expansion on the ground that it is vital,creative, infinite, and to dismiss whatever seems to set bounds toexpansion as something inert, mechanical, finite.
In its onslaughts onthe veto power whether within or without the breast of the individualit is plain that no age has ever approached the age of originalgenius in the midst of which we are still living.
Goethe defines thedevil as the spirit that always says no, and Carlyle celebrates hispassage from darkness to light as an escape from the Everlasting Nayto the Everlasting Yea.
We rarely pause to consider what a reversalof traditional wisdom is implied in such conceptions.
In the past,the spirit that says no has been associated rather with the divine.
Socrates tells us that the counsels of his “voice” were alwaysnegative, never positive.
95 According to the ancient Hindu again thedivine is the “inner check.
God, according to Aristotle, is pure Form.
In opposition to all this emphasis on the restricting and limitingpower, the naturalist, whether scientific or emotional, sets up aprogram of formless, fearless expansion; which means in practice thathe recognizes no bounds either to intellectual or emotional curiosity.
I have said that it is a part of the psychology of the original geniusto offer the element of wonder and surprise awakened by the perpetualnovelty, the infinite otherwiseness of things, as a substitute forthe awe that is associated with their infinite oneness; or rather torefuse to discriminate between these two infinitudes and so to confoundthe two main directions of the human spirit, its religious East, asone may say, with its West of wonder and romance.
This confusion maybe illustrated by the romantic attitude towards what is perhaps themost Eastern of all Eastern lands,--India.
The materials for the studyof India in the Occident were accumulated by Englishmen towards theend of the eighteenth century, but the actual interpretation of thismaterial is due largely to German romanticists, notably to FriedrichSchlegel.
96 Alongside the romantic Hellenist and the romanticmediævalist we find the romantic Indianist.
It is to India even morethan to Spain that one needs to turn, says Friedrich Schlegel, for thesupremely romantic97--that is, the wildest and most unrestrainedluxuriance of imagination.
Now in a country so vast and so ancient asIndia you can find in some place or at some period or other almostanything you like.
If, for example, W.
B.
Yeats waxes enthusiasticover Tagore we may be sure that there is in the work of Tagoresomething akin to æsthetic romanticism.
But if we take India at the topof her achievement in the early Buddhistic movement, let us say, weshall find something very different.
The early Buddhistic movement inits essential aspects is at the extreme opposite pole from romanticism.
The point is worth making because certain misinterpretations thatstill persist both of Buddhism and other movements in India canbe traced ultimately to the bad twist that was given to the wholesubject by romanticists like the Schlegels.
The educated Frenchman,for instance, gets his ideas of India largely from certain poems ofLeconte de Lisle who reflects the German influence.
But the sense ofuniversal and meaningless flux that pervades these poems without anycountervailing sense of a reality behind the shows of nature is aproduct of romanticism, working in coöperation with science, and istherefore antipodal to the absorption of the true Hindu in the onenessof things.
We are told, again, that Schopenhauer was a Buddhist.
Didhe not have an image of Buddha in his bedroom? But no doctrine perhapsis more remote from the genuine doctrine of Buddha than that of thissoured and disillusioned romanticist.
The nature of true Buddhism andits opposition to all forms of romanticism is worth dwelling on fora moment.
Buddha not only asserted the human law with unusual powerbut he also did what, in the estimation of some, needs doing in ourown day--he put this law, not on a traditional, but on a positive andcritical basis.
This spiritual positivism of Buddha is, reduced to itssimplest terms, a psychology of desire.
Not only is the world outsideof man in a constant state of flux and change, but there is an elementwithin man that is in constant flux and change also and makes itselffelt practically as an element of expansive desire.
What is unstable inhim longs for what is unstable in the outer world.
But he may escapefrom the element of flux and change, nay he must aspire to do so, ifhe wishes to be released from sorrow.
This is to substitute the noblefor the ignoble craving.
The permanent or ethical element in himselftowards which he should strive to move is known to him practically as apower of inhibition or inner check upon expansive desire.
Vital impulse(élan vital) may be subjected to vital control (frein vital).
Hereis the Buddhist equivalent of the “civil war in the cave” that theromanticist denies.
Buddha does not admit a soul in man in the sensethat is often given to the word, but on this opposition between vitalimpulse and vital control as a psychological fact he puts his supremeemphasis.
The man who drifts supinely with the current of desire isguilty according to Buddha of the gravest of all vices--spiritual ormoral indolence (pamāda).
He on the contrary who curbs or reins inhis expansive desires is displaying the chief of all the virtues,spiritual vigilance or strenuousness (appamāda).
The man who isspiritually strenuous has entered upon the “path.
The end of thispath and the goal of being cannot be formulated in terms of the finiteintellect, any more than the ocean can be put into a cup.
But progresson the path may be known by its fruits--negatively by the extinction ofthe expansive desires (the literal meaning of Nirvâna), positively byan increase in peace, poise, centrality.
A man’s rank in the scale of being is, then, according to the Buddhistdetermined by the quality of his desires; and it is within his power todetermine whether he shall let them run wild or else control them tosome worthy end.
We hear of the fatalistic East, but no doctrine wasever less fatalistic than that of Buddha.
No one ever put so squarelyupon the individual what the individual is ever seeking to evade--theburden of moral responsibility.
Self is the lord of self.
Who elsecan be the lord? … You yourself must make the effort.
The Buddhas areonly teachers.
98 But does not all this emphasis on self, one mayask, tend to hardness and indifference towards others, towards theundermining of that compassion to which the romantic moralist is readyto sacrifice all the other virtues? Buddha may be allowed to speak forhimself: “Even as a mother cherishes her child, her only child, so leta man cultivate a boundless love towards all beings.
99 Buddha thusseems to fulfil Pascal’s requirement for a great man: he unites inhimself opposite virtues and occupies all the space between them.
Enough has been said to make plain that the infinite indeterminatedesire of the romanticist and the Buddhist repression of desire are themost different things conceivable.
Chateaubriand it has been said wasan “invincibly restless soul,” a soul of desire (une âme de désir),but these phrases are scarcely more applicable to him than to manyother great romanticists.
They are fitly symbolized by the figures thatpace to and fro in the Hall of Eblis and whose hearts are seen throughtheir transparent bosoms to be lapped in the flames of unquenchablelonging.
The romanticist indeed bases, as I have said, on the veryintensity of his longing his claims to be an idealist and even amystic.
William Blake, for example, has been proclaimed a true mystic.
The same term has also been applied to Buddha.
Without pretending tohave fathomed completely so unfathomable a being as Buddha or even thefar less unfathomable William Blake, one may nevertheless assert withconfidence that Buddha and Blake stand for utterly incompatible viewsof life.
If Blake is a mystic then Buddha must be something else.
Tobe assured on this point one needs only to compare the “Marriage ofHeaven and Hell” with the “Dhammapada,” an anthology of some of themost authentic and authoritative material in early Buddhism.
He whodesires but acts not, breeds pestilence.
The road of excess leadsto the palace of wisdom,” says Blake.
Even in heavenly pleasures hefinds no satisfaction; the disciple who is fully awakened delightsonly in the destruction of all desires.
Good is restraint in allthings,” says Buddha.
Buddha would evidently have dismissed Blake asa madman, whereas Blake would have looked on Buddhism as the ultimateabomination.
My own conviction is that Buddha was a genuine sage wellworthy of the homage rendered him by multitudes of men for more thantwenty-four centuries, whereas Blake was only a romantic æsthete whowas moving in his imaginative activity towards madness and seems at theend actually to have reached the goal.
I have been going thus far afield to ancient India and to Buddha, notthat I might, like a recent student of Buddhism, enjoy “the strangenessof the intellectual landscape,” but on the contrary that I mightsuggest that there is a centre of normal human experience and thatBuddhism, at least in its ethical aspects, is nearer to this centrethan æsthetic romanticism.
Buddha might perhaps marvel with morereason at our strangeness than we at his.
Buddha’s assertion of man’sinnate moral laziness in particular accords more closely with whatmost of us have experienced than Rousseau’s assertion of man’s naturalgoodness.
This conception of the innate laziness of man seems to meindeed so central that I am going to put it at the basis of the pointof view I am myself seeking to develop, though this point of view isnot primarily Buddhistic.
This conception has the advantage of beingpositive rather than dogmatic.
It works out in practice very much likethe original sin of the Christian theologian.
The advantage of startingwith indolence rather than sin is that many men will admit that theyare morally indolent who will not admit that they are sinful.
Fortheological implications still cluster thickly about the word sin, andthese persons are still engaged more or less consciously in the greatnaturalistic revolt against theology.
The spiritual positivist then will start from a fact of immediateperception--from the presence namely in the breast of the individualof a principle of vital control (frein vital), and he will measurehis spiritual strenuousness or spiritual sloth by the degree to whichhe exercises or fails to exercise this power.
In accordance with thekeenness of a man’s perception of a specially human order that isknown practically as a curb upon his ordinary self, he may be said topossess insight.
The important thing is that the insight should notbe sophisticated, that a man should not fall away from it into somephantasmagoria of the intellect or emotions.
A man sometimes builds upa whole system of metaphysics as a sort of screen between himself andhis obligations either to himself or others.
Mrs.
Barbauld suspectedthat Coleridge’s philosophy was only a mask for indolence.
Carlyle’sphrase for Coleridge was even harsher: “putrescent indolence,” a phrasethat might be applied with more justice perhaps to Rousseau.
One maylearn from Rousseau the art of sinking to the region of instinct thatis below the rational level instead of struggling forward to theregion of insight that is above it, and at the same time passing for asublime enthusiast; the art of looking backwards and downwards, and atthe same time enjoying the honor that belongs only to those who lookforwards and up.
We need not wonder at the warm welcome that this newart received.
I have said that that man has always been accounted abenefactor who has substituted for the reality of spiritual disciplinesome ingenious art of going through the motions and that the decorum ofthe neo-classical period had largely sunk to this level.
Even in themost decorous of modern ages, that of Louis XIV, it was very common, asevery student of the period knows, for men to set up as personages inthe grand manner and at the same time behind the façade of conventionaldignity to let their appetites run riot.
It would have been perfectlylegitimate at the end of the eighteenth century to attack in the nameof true decorum a decorum that had become the “varnish of vice” and“mask of hypocrisy.
What Rousseau actually opposed to pseudo-decorumwas perhaps the most alluring form of sham spirituality that theworld has ever seen--a method not merely of masking but of glorifyingone’s spiritual indolence.
You wish to have the pleasures of viceand the honor of virtue,” wrote Julie to Saint-Preux in a moment ofunusual candor.
The Rousseauist may indulge in the extreme of psychicunrestraint and at the same time pose as a perfect idealist or even, ifone is a Chateaubriand, as a champion of religion.
Chateaubriand’s lifeaccording to Lemaître was a “magnificent series of attitudes.
I do not mean to assert that the Rousseauist is always guilty of thepose and theatricality of which there is more than a suggestion inChateaubriand.
There is, however, much in the Rousseauistic view oflife that militates against a complete moral honesty.
Of all the men Ihave known,” says Rousseau, “he whose character derives most completelyfrom his temperament alone is Jean-Jacques.
100 The ugly things thathave a way of happening when impulse is thus left uncontrolled donot, as we have seen, disturb the beautiful soul in his complacency.
He can always point an accusing finger at something or somebody else.
The faith in one’s natural goodness is a constant encouragement toevade moral responsibility.
To accept responsibility is to follow theline of maximum effort, whereas man’s secret desire is to follow, ifnot the line of least, at all events the line of lesser resistance.
The endless twisting and dodging and proneness to look for scapegoatsthat results is surely the least reputable aspect of human nature.
Rousseau writes to Madame de Francueil (20 April, 1751) that it washer class, the class of the rich, that was responsible for his havinghad to abandon his children.
With responsibility thus shifted fromone’s self to the rich, the next step is inevitable, namely to start acrusade against the members of a class which, without any warrant from“Nature,” oppresses its brothers, the members of other classes, andforces them into transgression.
A man may thus dodge his duties as afather, and at the same time pose as a paladin of humanity.
Rousseau isvery close here to our most recent agitators.
If a working girl fallsfrom chastity, for example, do not blame her, blame her employer.
Shewould have remained a model of purity if he had only added a dollar ortwo a week to her wage.
With the progress of the new morality everyone has become familiar with the type of the perfect idealist who isready to pass laws for the regulation of everybody and everythingexcept himself, and who knows how to envelop in a mist of radiant wordsschemes the true driving power of which is the desire to confiscateproperty.
The tendency to make of society the universal scapegoat is not, onescarcely needs add, to be ascribed entirely to the romantic moralist.
It is only one aspect of the denial of the human law, of the assumptionthat because man is partly subject to the natural law he is entirelysubject to it; and in this dehumanizing of man the rationalist hasbeen at least as guilty as the emotionalist.
If the Rousseauist hopesto find a substitute for all the restraining virtues in sympathy, therationalistic naturalist, who is as a rule utilitarian with a greateror smaller dash of pseudo-science, hopes to find a substitute for thesesame virtues in some form of machinery.
The legislative mill to whichour “uplifters” are so ready to resort, is a familiar example.
If ourmodern society continues to listen to those who are seeking to persuadeit that it is possible to find mechanical or emotional equivalents forself-control, it is likely, as Rousseau said of himself, to show a“great tendency to degenerate.
The fact on which the moral positivist would rest his effort torehabilitate self-control is, as I have said, the presence in man ofa restraining, informing and centralizing power that is anterior toboth intellect and emotion.
Such a power, it must be freely granted, isnot present equally in all persons; in some it seems scarcely to existat all.
When released from outer control, they are simply unchainedtemperaments; whereas in others this superrational perception seems tobe singularly vivid and distinct.
This is the psychological fact thatunderlies what the theologian would term the mystery of grace.
Rousseau himself was not quite so temperamental as might be inferredfrom what has been said about his evasion of ethical effort.
There weremoments when the dualism of the spirit came home to him, moments whenhe perceived that the conscience is not itself an expansive emotionbut rather a judgment and a check upon expansive emotion.
Yet hisgeneral readiness to subordinate his ethical self to his sensibility isindubitable.
Hence the absence in his personality and writing of thenote of masculinity.
There is indeed much in his make-up that remindsone less of a man than of a high-strung impressionable woman.
Woman,most observers would agree, is more natural in Rousseau’s sense, thatis, more temperamental, than man.
One should indeed always temperthese perilous comparisons of the sexes with the remark of La Fontainethat in this matter he knew a great many men who were women.
Now to betemperamental is to be extreme, and it is in this sense perhaps thatthe female of the species may be said to be “fiercer than the male.
Rousseau’s failure to find “any intermediary term between everythingand nothing” would seem to be a feminine rather than a masculinetrait.
Decorum in the case of women, even more perhaps than in thecase of men, tends to be a mere conformity to what is establishedrather than the immediate perception of a law of measure and proportionthat sets bounds to the expansive desires.
Women believe innocenteverything that they dare,” says Joubert, whom no one will accuse ofbeing a misogynist.
Those who are thus temperamental have more needthan others of outer guidance.
His feminine nature,” says C.
E.
Nortonof Ruskin, “needed support such as it never got.
101If women are more temperamental than men it is only fair to add thatthey have a greater fineness of temperament.
Women, says Joubert again,are richer in native virtues, men in acquired virtues.
At times whenmen are slack in acquiring virtues in the truly ethical sense--andsome might maintain that the present is such a time--the women maybe not only men’s equals but their superiors.
Rousseau had thisfeminine fineness of temperament.
He speaks rightly of his “exquisitefaculties.
He also had no inconsiderable amount of feminine charm.
Thenumerous members of the French aristocracy whom he fascinated may beaccepted as competent witnesses on this point.
The mingling of senseand spirit that pervades Rousseau, his pseudo-Platonism as I havecalled it elsewhere, is also a feminine rather than a masculine trait.
There is likewise something feminine in Rousseau’s preference forillusion.
Illusion is the element in which woman even more than manwould seem to live and move and have her being.
It is feminine andalso romantic to prefer to a world of sharp definition a world of magicand suggestiveness.
W.
Bagehot (it will be observed that in discussingthis delicate topic I am prone to take refuge behind authorities)attributes the triumph of an art of shifting illusion over an artof clear and firm outlines to the growing influence of women.
102Woman’s being is to that of man, we are told, as is moonlight untosunlight--and the moon is the romantic orb.
The whole of German romancein particular is bathed in moonshine.
103The objection of the classicist to the so-called enlightenment of theeighteenth century is that it did not have in it sufficient light.
Theprimitivists on the contrary felt that it had too much light--that thelight needed to be tempered by darkness.
Even the moon is too effulgentfor the author of “Hymns to the Night.
No movement has ever avowedmore openly its partiality for the dim and the crepuscular.
The Germanromanticists have been termed “twilight men.
What many of them admirein woman as in children and plants, is her unconsciousness and freedomfrom analysis--an admiration that is also a tribute in its way to the“night side” of nature.
104Discussions of the kind in which I have been indulging regarding theunlikeness of woman and man are very dreary unless one puts at leastequal emphasis on their fundamental likeness.
Woman, before beingwoman, is a human being and so subject to the same law as man.
So faras men and women both take on the yoke of this law, they move towardsa common centre.
So far as they throw it off and live temperamentally,there tends to arise the most odious of all forms of warfare--thatbetween the sexes.
The dictates of the human law are only too likelyto yield in the case of both men and women to the rush of outerimpressions and the tumult of the desires within.
This is what LaRochefoucauld means when he says that “the head is always the dupe ofthe heart.
Nevertheless feeling is even more likely to prevail overjudgment in woman than it is in man.
To be judicial indeed to thepoint of hardness and sternness has always been held to be unfeminine.
It is almost woman’s prerogative to err on the side of sympathy.
But even woman cannot be allowed to substitute sympathy for trueconscience--that is for the principle of control.
In basing conducton feeling Rousseau may be said to have founded a new sophistry.
The ancient sophist at least made man the measure of all things.
Bysubordinating judgment to sensibility Rousseau may be said to have madewoman the measure of all things.
The affirmation of a human law must ultimately rest on the perceptionof a something that is set above the flux upon which the flux itselfdepends--on what Aristotle terms an unmoved mover.
Otherwise consciencebecomes a part of the very flux and element of change it is supposedto control.
In proportion as he escapes from outer control man mustbe conscious of some such unmoved mover if he is to oppose a definiteaim or purpose to the indefinite expansion of his desires.
Having somesuch firm centre he may hope to carry through to a fortunate conclusionthe “civil war in the cave.
He may, as the wise are wont to expressit, build himself an island in the midst of the flood.
The romanticmoralist, on the other hand, instead of building himself an island issimply drifting with the stream.
For feeling not only shifts from manto man, it is continually shifting in the same man; so that moralitybecomes a matter of mood, and romanticism here as elsewhere might bedefined as the despotism of mood.
At the time of doing anything, saysMrs.
Shelley, Shelley deemed himself right; and Rousseau says thatin the act of abandoning his own children he felt “like a member ofPlato’s republic.
The man who makes self-expression and not self-control his primaryendeavor becomes subject to every influence, “the very slave ofcircumstance and impulse borne by every breath.
105 This is what itmeans in practice no longer to keep a firm hand on the rudder of one’spersonality, but to turn one’s self over to “nature.
The partisanof expression becomes the thrall of his impressions so that the wholeRousseauistic conception may be termed indifferently impressionistic orexpressionistic.
For the beautiful soul in order to express himself hasto indulge his emotions instead of hardening and bracing them againstthe shock of circumstance.
The very refinement of sensibility whichconstitutes in his own eyes his superiority to the philistine makes himquiver responsive to every outer influence; he finally becomes subjectto changes in the weather, or in Rousseau’s own phrase, the “vileplaything of the atmosphere and seasons.
This rapid shifting of mood in the romanticist, in response toinner impulse or outer impression, is almost too familiar to needillustration.
Here is an example that may serve for a thousand fromthat life-long devotee of the great god Whim--Hector Berlioz.
When atFlorence, Berlioz relates in his Memoirs, he received a letter fromthe mother of Camille, the woman he loved, informing him of Camille’smarriage to another.
In two minutes my plans were laid.
I must hurryto Paris to kill two guilty women and one innocent man; for, this actof justice done, I too must die.
Accordingly he loads his pistols,supplies himself with a disguise as a lady’s maid, so as to be ableto penetrate into the guilty household, and puts into his pockets“two little bottles, one of strychnine, the other of laudanum.
While awaiting the departure of the diligence he “rages up and downthe streets of Florence like a mad dog.
Later, as the diligence istraversing a wild mountain road, he suddenly lets out a “‘Ha’! sohoarse, so savage, so diabolic that the startled driver bounded asideas if he had indeed a demon for his fellow-traveller.
But on reachingNice he is so enchanted by the climate and environment that he notonly forgets his errand, but spends there “the twenty happiest days” ofhis life! There are times, one must admit, when it is an advantage tobe temperamental.
In this exaltation of environmental influences one should noteagain the coöperation of Rousseauist and Baconian, of emotional andscientific naturalist.
Both are prone to look upon man as being made bynatural forces and not as making himself.
To deal with the substitutesthat Rousseauist and Baconian have proposed for traditional morality,is in fact to make a study of the varieties--and they are numerous--ofnaturalistic fatalism.
The upshot of the whole movement is to discreditmoral effort on the part of the individual.
Why should a man believein the efficacy of this effort, why should he struggle to acquirecharacter if he is convinced that he is being moulded like putty byinfluences beyond his control--the influence of climate, for example?Both science and romanticism have vied with one another in making ofman a mere stop on which Nature may play what tune she will.
The Æolianharp enjoyed an extraordinary popularity as a romantic symbol.
The manof science for his part is ready to draw up statistical tables showingwhat season of the year is most productive of suicide and what type ofweather impels bank-cashiers most irresistibly to embezzlement.
A manon a mountain top, according to Rousseau, enjoys not only physical butspiritual elevation, and when he descends to the plain the altitudeof his mind declines with that of his body.
Ruskin’s soul, says C.
E.
Norton, “was like an Æolian harp, its strings quivering musically inserene days under the touch of the soft air, but as the clouds gatheredand the winds arose, vibrating in the blast with a tension that mightbreak the sounding board itself.
It is not surprising Ruskin makesother men as subject to “skyey influences” as himself.
The mountainsof the earth are,” he says, “its natural cathedrals.
True religion canscarcely be achieved away from them.
The curate or hermit of the fieldand fen, however simple his life or painful his lodging, does not oftenattain the spirit of the hill pastor or recluse: we may find in him adecent virtue or a contented ignorance, rarely the prophetic vision orthe martyr’s passion.
The corruptions of Romanism “are traceable forthe most part to lowland prelacy.
106Is then the Rousseauist totally unable to regulate his impressions?It is plain that he cannot control them from within because the wholeidea of a vital control of this kind is, as we have seen, foreign tothe psychology of the beautiful soul.
Yet it is, according to Rousseau,possible to base morality on the senses--on outer perception thatis--and at the same time get the equivalent of a free-will based oninner perception.
He was so much interested in this subject that hehad planned to devote to it a whole treatise to be entitled “Sensitivemorality or the materialism of the sage.
A man cannot resist an outerimpression but he may at least get out of its way and put himself inthe way of another impression that will impel him to the desired courseof conduct.
The soul may then be put or maintained in the state mostfavorable to virtue.
Climates, seasons, sounds, colors, darkness,light, the elements, food, noise, silence, movement, rest, everything,acts on our physical frame.
By a proper adjustment of all these outerelements we may govern in their origins the feelings by which we allowourselves to be dominated.
107Rousseau’s ideas about sensitive morality are at once highly chimericaland highly significant.
Here as elsewhere one may say with Amielthat nothing of Rousseau has been lost.
His point of view has aninner kinship with that of the man of science who asserts that man isnecessarily the product of natural forces, but that one may at leastmodify the natural forces.
For example, moral effort on the part ofthe individual cannot overcome heredity.
It is possible, however, byschemes of eugenics to regulate heredity.
The uneasy burden of moralresponsibility is thus lifted from the individual, and the moralistin the old-fashioned sense is invited to abdicate in favor of thebiologist.
It would be easy enough to trace similar assumptions in thevarious forms of socialism and other “isms” almost innumerable of thepresent hour.
Perhaps the problem to which I have already alluded may as well befaced here.
How does it happen that Rousseau who attacked both scienceand literature as the chief sources of human degeneracy should be anarch-æsthete, the authentic ancestor of the school of art for art’ssake and at the same time by his sensitive (or æsthetic) morality playinto the hands of the scientific determinist? If one is to enter deeplyinto the modern movement one needs to consider both wherein scientificand emotional naturalists clash and wherein they agree.
The two typesof naturalists agree in their virtual denial of a superrational realm.
They clash above all in their attitude towards what is on the rationallevel.
The scientific naturalist is assiduously analytical.
Rousseau,on the other hand, or rather one whole side of Rousseau, is hostileto analysis.
The arts and sciences are attacked because they are theproduct of reflection.
The man who reflects is a depraved animal,”because he has fallen away from the primitive spontaneous unity ofhis being.
Rousseau is the first of the great anti-intellectualists.
By assailing both rationalism and pseudo-classic decorum in the nameof instinct and emotion he appealed to men’s longing to get awayfrom the secondary and the derivative to the immediate.
True decorumsatisfies the craving for immediacy because it contains within itselfan element of superrational perception.
The “reason” of a Plato or anAristotle also satisfies the craving for immediacy because it likewisecontains within itself an element of superrational perception.
A reasonor a decorum of this kind ministers to another deep need of humannature--the need to lose itself in a larger whole.
Once eliminate thesuperrational perception and reason sinks to the level of rationalism,consciousness becomes mere self-consciousness.
It is difficult, asSt.
Evremond said, for man to remain in the long run in this doubtfulmiddle state.
Having lost the unity of insight, he will long for theunity of instinct.
Hence the paradox that this most self-consciousof all movements is filled with the praise of the unconscious.
Itabounds in persons who, like Walt Whitman, would turn and live with theanimals, or who, like Novalis, would fain strike root into the earthwith the plant.
Animals108 and plants are not engaged in any moralstruggle, they are not inwardly divided against themselves.
Here is the source of the opposition between the abstract andanalytical head, deadly to the sense of unity, and the warm immediateheart that unifies life with the aid of the imagination--an oppositionthat assumes so many forms from Rousseau to Bergson.
The Rousseauistalways betrays himself by arraigning in some form or other, “the falsesecondary power by which we multiply distinctions.
One should indeedremember that there were obscurantists before Rousseau.
Pascal alsoarrays the heart against the head; but his heart is at the farthestremove from that of Rousseau; it stands for a superrational perception.
Christians like Pascal may indulge with comparative impunity in acertain amount of obscurantism.
For they have submitted to a traditionthat supplies them with distinctions between good and evil and at thesame time controls their imagination.
But for the individualist whohas broken with tradition to deny his head in the name of his heart isa deadly peril.
He above all persons should insist that the power bywhich we multiply distinctions, though secondary, is not false--thatthe intellect, of however little avail in itself, is invaluable whenworking in coöperation with the imagination in the service of eitherinner or outer perception.
It is only through the analytical head andits keen discriminations that the individualist can determine whetherthe unity and infinitude towards which his imagination is reaching (andit is only through the imagination that one can have the sense of unityand infinitude) is real or merely chimerical.
Need I add that in makingthese distinctions between imagination, intellect, feeling, etc.
I am not attempting to divide man up into more or less watertightcompartments, into hard and fast “faculties,” but merely to express,however imperfectly, certain obscure and profound facts of experience?The varieties of what one may term the rationalistic error, of theendeavor of the intellect to emancipate itself from perception andset up as an independent power, are numerous.
The variety that wasperhaps formerly most familiar was that of the theologian who soughtto formulate intellectually what must ever transcend formulation.
Theforms of the rationalistic error that concern our present subject canbe traced back for the most part to Descartes, the father of modernphilosophy, and are indeed implicit in his famous identificationof thought and being (Je pense, donc je suis).
The dogmatic andarrogant rationalism that denies both what is above and what is belowitself, both the realm of awe and the realm of wonder, which prevailedamong the Cartesians of the Enlightenment, combined, as I have said,with pseudo-classic decorum to produce that sense of confinement andsmugness against which the original genius protested.
Man will alwayscrave a view of life to which perception lends immediacy and theimagination infinitude.
A view of life like that of the eighteenthcentury that reduces unduly the rôle of both imagination and perceptionwill always seem to him unvital and mechanical.
The Bounded,” saysBlake, “is loathed by its possessor.
The same dull round even of aUniverse would soon become a Mill with complicated wheels.
The mechanizing of life against which the romanticist protested mayas I said be largely associated with the influence of Descartes.
Itis not however the whole truth about Descartes to say that he forgotthe purely instrumental rôle of the intellect and encouraged it toset up as an independent power.
As a matter of fact he also used theintellect as an instrument in the service of outer perception.
Takingas his point of departure the precise observations that science wasaccumulating, he sought to formulate mathematically the natural law.
Now the more one reduces nature to a problem of space and movement,the more one is enabled to measure nature; and the method of exactmeasurement may be justified, if not on metaphysical, at least onpractical grounds.
It helps one, if not to understand natural forces,at least to control them.
It thereby increases man’s power andministers to utility.
In a word, the intellect when thus pressed intothe service of outer perception makes for material efficiency.
In asense science becomes scientific only in proportion as it neglectsthe qualitative differences between phenomena, e.
g.
between light andsound, and treats them solely from the point of view of quantity.
Butthe penalty that science pays for this quantitative method is a heavyone.
The farther it gets away from the warm immediacy of perceptionthe less real it becomes; for that only is real to a man that heimmediately perceives.
Perfectly pure science tends to become a seriesof abstract mathematical formulæ without any real content.
By hisresort to such a method, the man of science is in constant danger ofbecoming a mere rationalist.
At bottom he is ignorant of the realitythat lies behind natural phenomena; he must even be ignorant of it,for it lays hold upon the infinite, and so must elude a finite beinglike man.
But the desire to conceal his own ignorance from himself andothers, the secret push for power and prestige that lies deep down inthe breast of the man of science as in that of every other man, impelshim to attach an independent value to the operations of the intellectthat have only an instrumental value in the service of outer perceptionand to conceive that he has locked up physical nature in his formulæ.
The man of science thus falls victim to a special form of metaphysicalillusion.
The gravity of the error of the scientific intellectualist ismultiplied tenfold when he conceives that his formulæ cover not merelythe natural law but the human law as well, when he strives, like Taine,to convert man himself into a “walking theorem,” a “living geometry.
This denial of every form of spontaneity was rightly felt by theromanticists to be intolerable.
Goethe contrasts the smug satisfaction of Wagner in his dead formulæthat give only what is external and secondary, with Faust’s fiercecraving for immediacy and therefore his impatience with an analysisthat gives only the dry bones from which the vital breath has departed.
Wagner is a philistine because he is not tormented by the thirst forthe infinite.
Faust, on the other hand, reaches out beyond the mereintellect towards the spirit that is behind the shows of nature, butthis spirit appears to him and reduces him to despair by declaring thathe is trying to grasp something that is not only infinite but alien tohim.
Instead of turning from this alien spirit to the spirit that isrelevant to man, a spirit that sets bounds to every inordinate craving,including the inordinate craving for knowledge (libido sciendi),Faust gives himself to the devil in what was, in the time of theyouthful Goethe, the newest fashion: he becomes a Rousseauist.
Insteadof striking into the ascending path of insight, he descends to thelevel of impulse.
Seen from this level the power by which we multiplydistinctions seems to him, as it was to seem later to Wordsworth, notmerely secondary but false, and so definition yields to indiscriminatefeeling (Gefühl ist alles).
In general the Rousseauistic reply to theCartesian attempt to identify thought and being is the identificationof being with emotion (je sens donc je suis).
The Mephistopheles of Goethe has often been taken as a symbol ofthe iconoclastic and Voltairian side of the eighteenth century.
Therationalists assailed the traditional forms that imply a superrationalrealm as mere “prejudice,” and, failing to find in insight a substitutefor these discarded forms, they succumbed in turn to the emotionalists.
A “reason” that is not grounded in insight will always seem to menintolerably cold and negative and will prove unable to withstand theassault of the primary passions.
The reason of a Plato or an Aristotleis on a different footing altogether because, as I have said, itincludes an element of inner perception.
One may note here that thedifficulties of the present subject arise in no small degree from theambiguities that cluster about the word reason.
It may not only meanthe imaginative insight109 of a Plato and the abstract reasoningof a Descartes but is often employed by the classicist himself asa synonym of good sense.
Good sense may be defined as a correctperception of the ordinary facts of life and of their relation to oneanother.
It may be of very many grades, corresponding to the infinitediversity of the facts to be perceived.
A man may evidently have goodsense in dealing with one order of facts, and quite lack it in dealingwith some different order of facts.
As the result of long observationand experience of a multitude of minute relationships, of the factsthat ordinarily follow one another or coexist in some particular field,a man’s knowledge of this field becomes at last, as it were, automaticand unconscious.
A sea captain for example acquires at last anintuitive knowledge of the weather, the broker, an intuitive knowledgeof stocks.
The good sense or practical judgment of the sea captain inhis particular calling and of the broker in his is likely to be greaterthan that of less experienced persons.
One cannot, however, assert thata man’s good sense is always in strict ratio to his experience.
Somepersons seem to have an innate gift for seeing things as they are,others a gift equally innate for seeing things as they are not.
Again the field in which one displays one’s good sense or practicaljudgment may fall primarily under either the human law or the naturallaw, may belong in Aristotelian phrase to the domain either of theprobable or of the necessary.
To take a homely illustration, aman is free to choose the temperature of his bath, but only withinthe limits of natural necessity--in this case the temperature atwhich water freezes and that at which water boils.
He will show hispractical judgment by choosing water that is neither too hot nor toocold and this so far as he is concerned will be the golden mean.
Hereas elsewhere the golden mean is nothing mechanical, but may varynot only from individual to individual but in the same individualaccording to his age, the state of his health, etc.
In determining whatconforms to the golden mean or law of measure there must always be amediation between the particular instance and the general principle,and it is here that intuition is indispensable.
But even so there isa centre of normal human experience, and the person who is too farremoved from it ceases to be probable.
Aged persons may exist who findbathing in ice-water beneficial, but they are not representative.
Now creative art, in distinct ratio to its dignity, deals not withwhat may happen in isolated cases but with what happens according toprobability or necessity.
It is this preoccupation with the universalthat as Aristotle says makes poetry a more serious and philosophicalthing than history.
There enters indeed into true art an element ofvital novelty and surprise.
But the more cultivated the audience towhich the creator addresses himself the more will it insist that thesurprise be not won at the expense of motivation.
It will demand thatcharacters and incidents be not freakish, not too remote from thefacts that normally follow one another or coexist, whether in natureor human nature.
One needs, in short, to deal with both art and lifefrom some ethical centre.
The centre with reference to which one hasgood sense may be only the ethos of one’s time and country, but ifone’s good sense has, as in the case of the great poets, the supportof the imagination, it may pass beyond to something more abiding.
OfPope’s intellectual character,” says Dr.
Johnson, “the constituent andfundamental principle was good sense, a prompt and intuitive perceptionof consonance and propriety.
He saw immediately of his own conceptionswhat was to be chosen, and what to be rejected.
One may grant all thisand at the same time feel the difference between the “reason” of a Popeand the reason of a Sophocles.
Good sense of the kind Dr.
Johnson describes and decorum are notstrictly speaking synonymous.
To be decorous not only must one havea correct perception of what to do, but one must actually be able todo it; and this often requires a long and difficult training.
We haveseen that Rousseau’s spite against eighteenth-century Paris was largelydue to the fact that he had not acquired young enough the habits thatwould have made it possible for him to conform to its convention.
I affected,” says Rousseau with singular candor, “to despise thepoliteness I did not know how to practice.
As a matter of fact he hadnever adjusted himself to the decorum and good sense of any community.
His attitude towards life was fundamentally Bohemian.
But a person whowas sensible and decorous according to the standards of some othercountry might have emphasized the differences between his good senseand decorum and the good sense and decorum of eighteenth-century Paris.
The opponents of the traditional order in the eighteenth centurywere fond of introducing some Persian or Chinese to whom this orderseemed no true order at all but only “prejudice” or “abuse.
Theconclusion would seem to be that because the good sense and decorumof one time and country do not coincide exactly with those of anothertime and country, therefore good sense and decorum themselves havein them no universal element, and are entirely implicated in theshifting circumstances of time and place.
But behind the ethos ofany particular country, that of Greece, for instance, there are, asAntigone perceived, the “unwritten laws of heaven,” and something ofthis permanent order is sure to shine through even the most imperfectconvention.
Though no convention is final, though man and all heestablishes are subject to the law of change, it is therefore aninfinitely delicate and perilous task to break with convention.
Onecan make this break only in favor of insight; which is much as if oneshould say that the only thing that may safely be opposed to commonsense is a commoner sense, or if one prefers, a common sense that isbecoming more and more imaginative.
Even so, the wiser the man, onemay surmise, the less likely he will be to indulge in a violent andtheatrical rupture with his age, after the fashion of Rousseau.
He willlike Socrates remember the counsel of the Delphian oracle to followthe “usage of the city,”110 and while striving to gain a firmer holdupon the human law and to impose a more strenuous discipline upon hisordinary self, he will so far as possible conform to what he findsestablished.
A student of the past cannot help being struck by the factthat men are found scattered through different times and countries andliving under very different conventions who are nevertheless in virtueof their insight plainly moving towards a common centre.
So much sothat the best books of the world seem to have been written, as Emersonputs it, by one all-wise, all-seeing gentleman.
A curious circumstanceis that the writers who are most universal in virtue of theirimaginative reason or inspired good sense, are likewise as a rule thewriters who realized most intensely the life of their own age.
No otherSpanish writer, for example, has so much human appeal as Cervantes,and at the same time no other brings us so close to the heart ofsixteenth-century Spain.
In the writings attributed to Confucius oneencounters, mixed up with much that is almost inconceivably remote fromus, maxims that have not lost their validity to-day; maxims that aresure to be reaffirmed wherever and whenever men attain to the level ofhumanistic insight.
In the oldest Buddhist documents again one findsalong with a great deal that is very expressive of ancient India, andthus quite foreign to our idiosyncrasy, a good sense which is even moreimaginative and inspired, and therefore more universal, than that ofConfucius, and which is manifested, moreover, on the religious ratherthan on the humanistic level.
We are dealing here with indubitablefacts, and should plant ourselves firmly upon them as against those whowould exaggerate either the constant or the variable elements in humannature.
Enough has been said to show the ambiguities involved in the wordreason.
Reason may mean the abstract and geometrical reason of aDescartes, it may mean simply good sense, which may itself exist invery many grades ranging from an intuitive mastery of some particularfield to the intuitive mastery of the ethos of a whole age, like thereason of a Pope.
Finally reason may be imaginative and be therebyenabled to go beyond the convention of a particular time and country,and lay hold in varying degrees on “the unwritten laws of heaven.
Ihave already traced in some measure the process by which reason inthe eighteenth century had come to mean abstract and geometrical (oras one may say Cartesian) reason or else unimaginative good sense.
Cartesian reason was on the one hand being pressed into the serviceof science and its special order of perceptions; on the other hand itwas being used frequently in coöperation with an unimaginative goodsense to attack the traditional forms that imply a realm of insightwhich is above both abstract reason and ordinary good sense.
Men wereemboldened to use reason in this way because they were flushed notonly by the increasing mastery of man over nature through science,but by the positive and anti-traditional method through which thismastery had been won.
Both those who proclaimed and those who denied asuperrational realm were at least agreed in holding that the faith inany such realm was inseparable from certain traditional forms.
Pascal,for example, held not only that insight in religion is annexed tothe acceptance of certain dogmas--and this offended the new criticalspirit--but furthermore that insight could exist even in the orthodoxonly by a special divine gift or grace, and this offended man’sreviving confidence in himself.
People were ready to applaud when aVoltaire declared it was time to “take the side of human nature againstthis sublime misanthropist.
The insight into the law of decorum onwhich classicism must ultimately rest was in much the same way heldto be inseparable from the Græco-Roman tradition; and so the natureof classical insight as a thing apart from any tradition tended tobe obscured in the endless bickerings of ancients and moderns.
Theclassical traditionalists, however, were less prone than the Christiantraditionalists (Jansenists, Jesuits and Protestants) to weaken theircause still further by wrangling among themselves.
Inasmuch as both Christians and humanists failed to plant themselveson the fact of insight, the insight came more and more to berejected along with the special forms from which it was deemed to beinseparable.
As a result of this rejection “reason” was left to copeunaided with man’s impulses and expansive desires.
Now Pascal sawrightly that the balance of power in such a conflict between reasonand impulse was held by the imagination, and that if reason lackedthe support of insight the imagination would side with the expansivedesires and reason would succumb.
Moreover the superrational insight,or “heart” as Pascal calls it, that can alone keep man from beingthus overwhelmed, comes, as he holds, not through reason but throughgrace and is at times actually opposed to reason.
The heart,” hesays, “has reasons of which the reason knows nothing.
Instead ofprotesting against the asceticism of this view as the true positivistwould do, instead of insisting that reason and imagination may pulltogether harmoniously in the service of insight, the romantic moralistopposed to the superrational “heart” of the austere Christian asubrational “heart,” and this involved an attempt to base moralityon the very element in human nature it is designed to restrain.
Thepositivist will plant himself first of all on the fact of insight andwill define it as the immediate perception of a something anteriorto both thought and feeling, that is known practically as a power ofcontrol over both.
The beautiful soul, as we have seen, has no placefor any such power in his scheme of things, but hopes to satisfy allethical elements simply by letting himself go.
Rousseau (followingShaftesbury and Hutcheson) transforms conscience itself from an innercheck into an expansive emotion.
While thus corrupting consciencein its very essence he does not deny conscience.
On the contrary hegrows positively rhapsodic over conscience and other similar words.
Rousseau took wisdom from men’s souls,” says Joubert, “by talking tothem of virtue.
In short, Rousseau displays the usual dexterity of thesophist in juggling with ill-defined general terms.
If one calls forsharp definition one is at once dismissed as a mere rationalist whois retreating into a false secondary power from a warm immediacy.
Thetraditional distinctions regarding good and bad were thus discardedat the same time that discredit was cast on the keen analysis withwhich it would have been possible to build up new distinctions--allin favor of an indiscriminate emotionalism.
This discomfiture of bothtradition and analysis in the field of the human law would not havebeen so easy if at the same time man’s active attention and effort hadnot been concentrated more and more on the field of the natural law.
In that field imagination and the analytical intellect were actuallypulling together in the service of perception with the result that manwas constantly gaining in power and utility.
Emotional romanticists andscientific utilitarians have thus, in spite of their surface clashes,cooperated during the past century in the dehumanizing of man.
It is not enough to say of the representatives of both sides of thisgreat naturalistic movement that they eliminate the veto power fromhuman nature while continuing to use the old words, like virtue andconscience, that imply a veto power.
We have seen that they actuallyattack the veto power as synonymous with evil.
The devil is conceivedas the spirit that always says no.
A purely affirmative moralityis almost necessarily an emotional morality.
If there is no regionof insight above the reason which is felt by the natural man as anelement of vital control, and if cold reason, reason unsupported byinsight, never has done anything illustrious, as Rousseau truly says,it follows that the only way to put driving power behind reason is toturn virtue into a passion,--a passion that differs from other passionsmerely in its greater imperiousness.
For the beautiful soul virtue,as we have seen in the case of Robespierre, is not only a tender,imperious and voluptuous passion but even an intoxication.
I was,if not virtuous,” says Rousseau, “at least intoxicated with virtue.
In its extreme manifestations romantic morality is indeed only oneaspect, and surely the most singular aspect, of the romantic cult ofintoxication.
No student of romanticism can fail to be struck by itspursuit of delirium, vertigo and intoxication for their own sake.
Itis important to see how all these things are closely related to oneanother and how they all derive from the attempt to put life on anemotional basis.
To rest conscience, for example, on emotion is to restit on what is always changing, not only from man to man but from momentto moment in the same man.
If,” as Shelley says, “nought is, but thatit feels itself to be,” it will feel itself to be very different thingsat different times.
No part of man is exempt from the region of fluxand change.
There is, as James himself points out, a kinship betweensuch a philosophy of pure motion and vertigo.
Faust after all is onlyconsistent when having identified the spirit that says no, which isthe true voice of conscience, with the devil, he proceeds to dedicatehimself to vertigo (dem Taumel weih’ ich mich).
Rousseau also, asreaders of the “Confessions” will remember, deliberately courtedgiddiness by gazing down on a waterfall from the brink of a precipice(making sure first that the railing on which he leaned was good andstrong).
This naturalistic dizziness became epidemic among the Greeksat the critical moment of their break with traditional standards.
Whirl is King,” cried Aristophanes, “having driven out Zeus.
Themodern sophist is even more a votary of the god Whirl than the Greek,for he has added to the mobility of an intellect that has no support ineither tradition or insight the mobility of feeling.
Many Rousseauistswere, like Hazlitt, attracted to the French Revolution by its “grandwhirling movements.
Even more significant than the cult of vertigo is the closely alliedcult of intoxication.
Man being reasonable,” says Byron, with trueRousseauistic logic, “must therefore get drunk.
The best of life isbut intoxication.
The subrational and impulsive self of the man whohas got drunk is not only released from the surveillance of reasonin any sense of the word, but his imagination is at the same tuneset free from the limitations of the real.
If many Rousseauists havebeen rightly accused of being “lovers of delirium,” that is becausein delirium the fancy is especially free to wander wild in its ownempire of chimeras.
To compose a poem, as Coleridge is supposed to havecomposed “Kubla Khan,” in an opium dream without any participation ofhis rational self is a triumph of romantic art.
I should have takenmore opium when I wrote it,” said Friedrich Schlegel in explanation ofthe failure of his play “Alarcos.
What more specially concerns ourpresent topic is the carrying over of this subrational “enthusiasm”into the field of ethical values, and this calls for certain carefuldistinctions.
Genuine religion--whether genuine Christianity or genuineBuddhism--is plainly unfriendly in the highest degree to every form ofintoxication.
Buddhism, for example, not only prohibits the actual useof intoxicants but it pursues implacably all the subtler intoxicationsof the spirit.
The attitude of the humanist towards intoxication issomewhat more complex.
He recognizes how deep in man’s nature is thecraving for some blunting of the sharp edge of his consciousness andat least a partial escape from reason and reality; and so he oftenmakes a place on the recreative side of life for such moments of escapeeven if attained with the aid of wine.
Dulce est desipere in loco.
Pindar, who displays so often in his verse the high seriousness of theethical imagination, is simply observing the decorum of the occasionwhen he celebrates in a song for the end of a feast “the time when thewearisome cares of men have vanished from their reasons and on a widesea of golden wealth we are all alike voyaging to some visionary shore.
He that is penniless is then rich, and even they that are wealthy findtheir hearts expanding, when they are smitten by the arrows of thevine.
The true Greek, one scarcely needs add, put his final emphasis,as befitted a child of Apollo, not on intoxication but on the law ofmeasure and sobriety--on preserving the integrity of his mind, torender literally the Greek word for the virtue that he perhaps prizedthe most.
111 One must indeed remember that alongside the Apollonianelement in Greek life is the orgiastic or Dyonisiac element.
But whenEuripides sides imaginatively with the frenzy of Dionysus, as he doesin his “Bacchae,” though ostensibly preaching moderation, we may affirmthat he is falling away from what is best in the spirit of Hellas andrevealing a kinship with the votaries of the god Whirl.
The cult ofintoxication has as a matter of fact appeared in all times and placeswhere men have sought to get the equivalent of religious vision and thesense of oneness that it brings without rising above the naturalisticlevel.
True religious vision is a process of concentration, the resultof the imposition of the veto power upon the expansive desires of theordinary self.
The various naturalistic simulations of this visionare, on the contrary, expansive, the result of a more or less completeescape from the veto power, whether won with the aid of intoxicants ornot.
The emotional romanticists from Rousseau down have left no doubtas to the type of vision they represented.
Rousseau dilates with a sortof fellow feeling on the deep potations that went on in the tavernsof patriarchal Geneva.
112 Renan looks with disfavor on those whoare trying to diminish drunkenness among the common people.
He merelyasks that this drunkenness “be gentle, amiable, accompanied by moralsentiments.
Perhaps this side of the movement is best summed up in thefollowing passage of William James: “The sway of alcohol over mankindis unquestionably due to its power to stimulate the mystical facultiesof human nature, usually crushed to earth by the cold facts and drycriticisms of the sober hour.
Sobriety diminishes, discriminates andsays no; drunkenness expands, unites, and says yes.
It is, in fact, thegreat exciter of the Yes function in man.
It brings its votary fromthe chill periphery of things to the radiant core.
It makes him for themoment one with truth.
113The American distiller who named one of his brands “Golden DreamWhiskey” was evidently too modest.
If an adept in the new psychology hemight have set up as a pure idealist, as the opener up of an especiallyradiant pathway to the “truth.
The primitivist then attacks sober discrimination as an obstacle bothto warm immediacy of feeling and to unity.
He tends to associate theemotional unity that he gains through intoxication with the unity ofinstinct which he so admires in the world of the subrational.
Theromantic character,” says Ricarda Huch, “is more exposed to wasteitself in debaucheries than any other; for only in intoxication,whether of love or wine, when the one half of its being, consciousness,is lulled to sleep, can it enjoy the bliss for which it envies everybeast--the bliss of feeling itself one.
114 The desires of theanimal, however, work within certain definite limits.
They are not,like those of the primitivist, inordinate, the explanation being thatthey are less stimulated than the desires of the primitivist by theimagination.
Even if he gets rid of intellect and moral effort, theprimitivist cannot attain the unity of instinct because he remains tooimaginative; at the same time he proclaims and proclaims rightly thatthe imagination is the great unifying power--the power that can alonesave us from viewing things in “disconnection dead and spiritless.
We should attend carefully at this point for we are coming to theheart of the great romantic sophism.
The Rousseauist does not attainto the unity of the man whose impulses and desires are controlled anddisciplined to some ethical centre.
He does not, in spite of all hispraise of the unconscious and of the “sublime animals,” attain to theunity of instinct.
In what sense then may he be said to attain unity?The obvious reply is that he attains unity only in dreamland.
Forthe nature to which he would return, one cannot repeat too often, isnothing real, but a mere nostalgic straining of the imagination awayfrom the real.
It is only in dreamland that one can rest unity on theexpansive forces of personality that actually divide not only oneindividual from another but the same individual from himself.
It isonly in dreamland that, in the absence of both inner and outer control,“all things” will “flow to all, as rivers to the sea.
Such a unitywill be no more than a dream unity, even though one term it the idealand sophisticate in its favor all the traditional terms of religion andmorality.
A question that forces itself at every stage upon the studentof this movement is: What is the value of unity without reality?For two things are equally indubitable: first, that romanticism onthe philosophical side, is a protest in the name of unity against thedisintegrating analysis of the eighteenth-century rationalist; second,that what the primitivist wants in exchange for analysis is not realitybut illusion.
Rousseau who inclines like other æsthetes to identify thetrue with the beautiful was, we are told, wont to exclaim: “There isnothing beautiful save that which is not”; a saying to be matched withthat of “La Nouvelle Héloïse”: “The land of chimeras is alone worthyof habitation.
Similar utterances might be multiplied from French,English, and German romanticists.
115 To be sure, the word “reality”is perhaps the most slippery of all general terms.
Certain recentvotaries of the god Whirl, notably Bergson, have promised us that ifwe surrender to the flux we shall have a “vision” not only of unitybut also of reality; and so they have transferred to the cult of theirdivinity all the traditional language of religion.
We do not, however, need for the present to enter into a discussion asto the nature of reality, but simply to stick to strict psychologicalobservation.
From this point of view it is not hard to see that theprimitivist makes his primary appeal not to man’s need for unity andreality but to a very different need.
Byron has told us what this needis in his tale (“The Island”) of a ship’s crew that overpowered itsofficers and then set sail for Otaheite; what impelled these Arcadianmutineers was not the desire for a genuine return to aboriginal lifewith its rigid conventions, but    The wish--which ages have not yet subdued    In man--to have no master save his mood.
Now to have no master save one’s mood is to be wholly temperamental.
In Arcadia--the ideal of romantic morality--those who are whollytemperamental unite in sympathy and brotherly love.
It remains toconsider more fully what this triumph of temperament means in the realworld.
CHAPTER VROMANTIC MORALITY: THE REALThe fundamental thing in Rousseauistic morality is not, as we haveseen, the assertion that man is naturally good, but the denial ofthe “civil war in the cave.
Though this denial is not complete inRousseau himself, nothing is more certain than that his whole tendencyis away from this form of dualism.
The beautiful soul does the rightthing not as a result of effort, but spontaneously, unconsciously andalmost inevitably.
In fact the beautiful soul can scarcely be said tobe a voluntary agent at all.
Nature” acts in him and for him.
Thisminimizing of moral struggle and deliberation and choice, this drifttowards a naturalistic fatalism, as it may be termed, is a far moresignificant thing in Rousseau than his optimism.
One may as a matterof fact eliminate dualism in favor of nature and at the same time lookon nature as evil.
This is precisely what one is likely to do if onesees no alternative to temperamental living, while judging those wholive temperamentally not by their “ideal,” that is by their feeling oftheir own loveliness, but by what they actually do.
One will becomea realist in the sense that came to be attached to this word duringthe latter part of the nineteenth century.
Rousseau himself is oftenrealistic in this sense when he interrupts his Arcadian visions totell us what actually occurred.
In the “Confessions,” as I have said,passages that recall Lamartine alternate with passages that recallZola, and the transition from one type of passage to the other isoften disconcertingly sudden.
In reading these realistic passages ofRousseau we are led to reflect that his “nature” is not, in practice,so remote from Taine’s nature as might at first appear.
What wecall nature,” says Taine, “is this brood of secret passions, oftenmaleficent, generally vulgar, always blind, which tremble and fretwithin us, ill-covered by the cloak of decency and reason under whichwe try to disguise them; we think we lead them and they lead us; wethink our actions our own, they are theirs.
116The transition from an optimistic to a pessimistic naturalism can befollowed with special clearness in the stages by which the sentimentaldrama of the eighteenth century passes over into the realistic drama ofa later period.
Petit de Julleville contrasts the beginning and the endof this development as follows: “In the eighteenth century to pleasethe public you had to say to it: ‘You are all at least at bottom good,virtuous, full of feeling.
Let yourselves go, follow your instincts;listen to nature and you will do the right thing spontaneously.
Howchanged times are! Nowadays117 any one who wishes to please, to beread and petted and admired, to pass for great and become very rich,should address men as follows: ‘You are a vile pack of rogues, andprofligates, you have neither faith nor law; you are impelled by yourinstincts alone and these instincts are ignoble.
Do not try though tomend matters, that would be of no use at all.
118The connecting link between these different forms of the drama isnaturalistic fatalism, the suppression of moral responsibility foreither man’s goodness or badness.
Strictly speaking, the intrusion ofthe naturalistic element into the realm of ethical values and thesubversion by it of deliberation and choice and of the normal sequenceof moral cause and effect is felt from the human point of view not asfate at all, but as chance.
Emotional romanticism joins at this pointwith other forms of romanticism, which all show a proclivity to preferto strict motivation, to probability in the Aristotelian sense, what isfortuitous and therefore wonderful.
This is only another way of sayingthat the romanticist is moving away from the genuinely dramatic towardsmelodrama.
Nothing is easier than to establish the connection betweenemotional romanticism and the prodigious efflorescence of melodrama,the irresponsible quest for thrills, that has marked the past century.
What perhaps distinguishes this movement from any previous one is theattempt to invest what is at bottom a melodramatic view of life withphilosophic and even religious significance.
By suppressing the “civilwar in the cave” one strikes at the very root of true drama.
It doesnot then much matter from the dramatic point of view whether the burdenof responsibility for good or evil of which you have relieved theindividual is shifted upon “nature” or society.
Shelley, for example,puts the blame for evil on society.
Prometheus Unbound,” in which hehas developed his conception, is, judged as a play, only an etherealmelodrama.
The unaccountable collapse of Zeus, a monster of unalloyedand unmotivated badness, is followed by the gushing forth in man ofan equally unalloyed and unmotivated goodness.
The whole genius ofHugo, again, as I have said in speaking of his use of antithesis, ismelodramatic.
His plays may be described as parvenu melodramas.
Theyabound in every variety of startling contrast and strange happening,the whole pressed into the service of “problems” manifold and even of aphilosophy of history.
At the same time the poverty of ethical insightand true dramatic motivation is dissimulated under profuse lyricaloutpourings and purple patches of local color.
His Hernani actuallyglories in not being a responsible agent, but an “unchained and fatalforce,”119 and so more capable of striking astonishment into himselfand others.
Yet the admirers of Hugo would not only promote him to thefirst rank of poets, but would have us share his own belief that he isa seer and a prophet.
It may be objected that the great dramatists of the past exalt thispower of fate and thus diminish moral responsibility.
But the verysharpest distinction must be drawn between the subrational fate of theemotional romanticist and the superrational fate of Greek tragedy.
The fate of Æschylean tragedy, for instance, so far from underminingmoral responsibility rather reinforces it.
It is felt to be therevelation of a moral order of which man’s experience at any particularmoment is only an infinitesimal fragment.
It does not seem, like thesubrational fate of the emotional romanticist, the intrusion into thehuman realm of an alien power whether friendly or unfriendly.
Thispoint might be established by a study of the so-called fate drama inGermany (Schicksaltragödie), which, though blackly pessimistic, isclosely related to the optimistic sentimental drama of the eighteenthcentury.
120 The German fate drama is in its essence ignoble becauseits characters are specimens of sensitive morality--incapable, that is,of opposing a firm human purpose to inner impulse or outer impression.
The fate that thus wells up from the depths of nature and overwhelmstheir wills is not only malign and ironical, but as Grillparzer says,makes human deeds seem only “throws of the dice in the blind night ofchance.
121 It would be easy to follow similar conceptions of fatedown through later literature at least to the novels of Thomas Hardy.
Some of the earlier exponents of the sentimental drama, like Diderot,were not so certain as one might expect that the discarding oftraditional decorum in favor of “nature” would result practically in areign of pure loveliness.
At one moment Diderot urges men to get ridof the civil war in the cave in order that they may be Arcadian, likethe savages of the South Sea, but at other moments--as in “Rameau’sNephew”--he shows a somewhat closer grip on the problem of what willactually come to pass when a man throws off the conventions of a highlyorganized civilization and sets out to live temperamentally.
Diderotsees clearly that he will be that least primitive of all beings, theBohemian.
Rameau’s nephew, in his irresponsibility and emotionalinstability, in the kaleidoscopic shiftings of his mood, anticipatesall the romantic Bohemians and persons of “artistic temperament” whowere to afflict the nineteenth century.
But he is more than a mereæsthete.
At moments we can discern in him the first lineaments of thesuperman, who knows no law save the law of might.
One should recollectthat the actual influence of Diderot in France fell in the secondrather than in the first half of the nineteenth century--was upon therealists rather than upon the romanticists.
The same men that had acult for Diderot admired the Vautrins and the Rastignacs of Balzac andthe Julien Sorel of Stendhal.
These characters are little Napoleons.
They live temperamentally in the midst of a highly organized society,but they set aside its conventions of right and wrong in favor, not ofæsthetic enjoyment, but of power.
The ideal of romantic morality, as was seen in the last chapter,is altruism.
The real, it should be clear from the examples I havebeen citing, is always egoism.
But egoism may assume very differentforms.
As to the main forms of egoism in men who have repudiatedouter control without acquiring self-control we may perhaps reviveprofitably the old Christian classification of the three lusts--thelust of knowledge, the lust of sensation, and the lust of power.
Goethe indeed may be said to have treated these three main ways ofbeing temperamental in three of his early characters--the lust ofknowledge in “Faust,” the lust of sensation in “Werther,” and thelust of power in “Götz.
If we view life solely from the naturalisticlevel and concern ourselves solely with the world of action, we arejustified in neglecting, like Hobbes, the other lusts and puttingsupreme emphasis on the lust for power.
122 Professor F.
J.
Mather,Jr.
has distinguished between “hard” and “soft” sentimentalists.
123His distinction might perhaps be brought more closely into line withmy own distinctions if I ventured to coin a word and to speak of hardand soft temperamentalists.
The soft temperamentalist will prove unableto cope in the actual world with the hard temperamentalist, and isvery likely to become his tool.
Balzac has very appropriately madeLucien de Rubempré, the romantic poet and a perfect type of a softtemperamentalism, the tool of Vautrin, the superman.
Here indeed is the supreme opposition between the ideal and the realin romantic morality.
The ideal to which Rousseau invites us is eitherthe primitivistic anarchy of the “Second Discourse,” in which egoism istempered by “natural pity,” or else a state such as is depicted in the“Social Contract,” in which egoism is held in check by a disinterested“general will.
The preliminary to achieving either of these ideals isthat the traditional checks on human nature should be removed.
But inexact proportion as this programme of emancipation is carried out whatemerges in the real world is not the mythical will to brotherhood, butthe ego and its fundamental will to power.
Give a bootblack half theuniverse, according to Carlyle, and he will soon be quarreling withthe owner of the other half.
He will if he is a very temperamentalbootblack.
Perhaps indeed all other evils in life may be reduced to thefailure to check that something in man that is reaching out for moreand ever for more.
In a society in which the traditional inhibitionsare constantly growing weaker, the conflict I have just sketchedbetween the ideal and the real is becoming more and more acute.
Thesoft temperamentalists are overflowing with beautiful professionsof brotherly love, and at the same time the hard temperamentalistsare reaching out for everything in sight; and inasmuch as the hardtemperamentalists operate not in dreamland, but in the real world,they are only too plainly setting the tone.
Very often, of course,the same temperamentalist has his hard and his soft side.
The triumphof egoism over altruism in the relations between man and man is evenmore evident in the relations between nation and nation.
The egoismthat results from the inbreeding of temperament on a national scaleruns in the case of the strong nations into imperialism.
124 We havenot reflected sufficiently on the fact that the soft temperamentalistRousseau is more than any other one person the father of Kultur;125and that the exponents of Kultur in our own day have been revealed asthe hardest of hard temperamentalists.
To understand the particular craving that is met by Rousseauisticidealism one would need to go with some care into the psychology ofthe half-educated man.
The half-educated man may be defined as the manwho has acquired a degree of critical self-consciousness sufficientto detach him from the standards of his time and place, but notsufficient to acquire the new standards that come with a more thoroughcultivation.
It was pointed out long ago that the characteristic of thehalf-educated man is that he is incurably restless; that he is filledwith every manner of desire.
In contrast with him the uncultivated man,the peasant, let us say, and the man of high cultivation have few andsimple desires.
Thus Socrates had fewer and simpler desires than theaverage Athenian.
But what is most noteworthy about the half-educatedman is not simply that he harbors many desires and is thereforeincurably restless, but that these desires are so often incompatible.
He craves various good things, but is not willing to pay the price--notwilling to make the necessary renunciations.
He pushes to an extremewhat is after all a universal human proclivity--the wish to have one’scake and eat it too.
Thus, while remaining on the naturalistic level,he wishes to have blessings that accrue only to those who rise to thehumanistic or religious levels.
He wishes to live in “a universe withthe lid off,” to borrow a happy phrase from the pragmatist, and at thesame time to enjoy the peace and brotherhood that are the fruits ofrestraint.
The moral indolence of the Rousseauist is such that he isunwilling to adjust himself to the truth of the human law; and thoughliving naturalistically, he is loath to recognize that what actuallyprevails on the naturalistic level is the law of cunning and the lawof force.
He thus misses the reality of both the human and the naturallaw and in the pursuit of a vague Arcadian longing falls into sheerunreality.
I am indeed overstating the case so far as Rousseau isconcerned.
He makes plain in the “Emile” that the true law of natureis not the law of love but the law of force.
Emile is to be releasedfrom the discipline of the human law and given over to the disciplineof nature; and this means in practice that he will have “to bow hisneck beneath the hard yoke of physical necessity.
In so far the“nature” of Emile is no Arcadian dream.
Where the Arcadian dreamingbegins is when Rousseau assumes that an Emile who has learned thelesson of force from Nature herself, will not pass along this lessonto others, whether citizens of his own or some other country, but willrather display in his dealings with them an ideal fraternity.
In theearly stages of the naturalistic movement, in Hobbes and Shaftesbury,for example, egoism and altruism, the idea of power and the idea ofsympathy, are more sharply contrasted than they are in Rousseau and thelater romanticists.
Shaftesbury assumes in human nature an altruisticimpulse or will to brotherhood that will be able to cope successfullywith the will to power that Hobbes declares to be fundamental.
Many ofthe romanticists, as we have seen, combine the cult of power with thecult of brotherhood.
Hercules, as in Shelley’s poem, is to bow downbefore Prometheus, the lover of mankind.
The extreme example, however,is probably William Blake.
He proclaims himself of the devil’s party,he glorifies a free expansion of energy, he looks upon everything thatrestricts this expansion as synonymous with evil.
At the same time hepushes his exaltation of sympathy to the verge of the grotesque.
126Such indeed is the jumble of incompatibles in Blake that he wouldrest an illimitable compassion on the psychology of the superman.
Fornothing is more certain than that the “Marriage of Heaven and Hell”is among other things a fairly complete anticipation of Nietzsche.
The reasons are worth considering why the idea of power and the ideaof sympathy which Blake and so many other romanticists hoped to unitehave once more come to seem antipodal, why in the late stages of themovement one finds a Nietzsche and a Tolstoy, just as in its earlystages one finds a Hobbes and a Shaftesbury.
It is plain, first ofall, that what brought the two cults together for a time was theircommon hatred of the past.
With the triumph over the past fairlycomplete, the incompatibility of power and sympathy became increasinglymanifest.
Nietzsche’s attitude is that of a Prometheus whose sympathyfor mankind has changed to disgust on seeing the use that they areactually making of their emancipation.
Humanitarian sympathy seemedto him to be tending not merely to a subversion, but to an inversionof values, to a positive preference for the trivial and the ignoble.
He looked with special loathing on that side of the movement that issymbolized in its homage to the ass.
The inevitable flying apart ofpower and sympathy was further hastened in Nietzsche and others bythe progress of evolution.
Darwinism was dissipating the Arcadianmist through which nature had been viewed by Rousseau and his earlyfollowers.
The gap is wide between Tennyson’s nature “red in tooth andclaw” and the tender and pitiful nature of Wordsworth.
127 Nietzsche’spreaching of ruthlessness is therefore a protest against the sheerunreality of those who wish to be natural and at the same timesympathetic.
But how are we to get a real scale of values to oppose toan indiscriminate sympathy? It is here that Nietzsche shows that heis caught in the same fatal coil of naturalism as the humanitarian.
He accepts the naturalistic corruption of conscience which underliesall other naturalistic corruptions.
The will to overcome an emotion,”he says, “is ultimately only the will of another or of several otheremotions.
128 All he can do with this conception of conscience isto set over against the humanitarian suppression of values a scaleof values based on force and not a true scale of values based on thedegree to which one imposes or fails to impose on one’s temperamentalself a human law of vital control.
The opposition between a Nietzscheand a Tolstoy is therefore not specially significant; it is only thatbetween the hard and the soft temperamentalist.
To be sure Nietzschecan on occasion speak very shrewdly about the evils that have resultedfrom temperamentalism--especially from the passion for an untrammeledself-expression.
But the superman himself is a most authenticdescendant of the original genius in whom we first saw this passiondominant.
The imagination of the superman, spurning every centre ofcontrol, traditional or otherwise, so coöperates with his impulsesand desires as to give them “infinitude,” that is so as to makethem reach out for more and ever for more.
The result is a frenziedromanticism.
129“Proportionateness is strange to us, let us confess it to ourselves,”says Nietzsche.
Our itching is really the itching for the infinite,the immeasurable.
How the humanitarian loses proportionateness isplain; it is by his readiness to sacrifice to sympathy the ninetyper cent or so of the virtues that imply self-control.
The supermanwould scarcely seem to redress the balance by getting rid of the samerestraining virtues in favor of power.
He simply oscillates wildlyfrom the excess of which he is conscious in others or in himself intothe opposite excess, at imminent peril in either case to the ethicalbasis of civilization.
The patterns or models that the past had setup for imitation and with reference to which one might rein in hislusts and impose upon them proportionateness are rejected by everytype of romantic expansionist, not only as Nietzsche says, becausethey do not satisfy the yearning for the infinite, but also, as wehave seen, because they do not satisfy the yearning for unity andimmediacy.
Now so far as the forms of the eighteenth century wereconcerned the romantic expansionist had legitimate grounds for protest.
But because the rationalism and artificial decorum of that periodfailed to satisfy, he goes on to attack the analytical intellectand decorum in general and this attack is entirely illegitimate.
Itmay be affirmed on the contrary that the power by which we multiplydistinctions is never so necessary as in an individualistic age, an agethat has broken with tradition on the ground that it wishes to be moreimaginative and immediate.
There are various ways of being imaginativeand immediate, and analysis is needed, not to build up some abstractsystem but to discriminate between the actual data of experience andso to determine which one of these ways it is expedient to follow ifone wishes to become wise and happy.
It is precisely at such momentsof individualistic break with the past that the sophist stands readyto juggle with general terms, and the only protection against suchjuggling is to define these terms with the aid of the most unflinchinganalysis.
Thus Bergson would have us believe that there are in Francetwo main types of philosophy, a rationalistic type that goes back toDescartes and an intuitive type that goes back to Pascal,130 andgives us to understand that, inasmuch as he is an intuitionist, heis in the line of descent from Pascal.
Monstrous sophistries lurk inthis simple assertion, sophistries which if they go uncorrected areenough to wreck civilization.
The only remedy is to define the wordintuition, to discriminate practically and by their fruits betweensubrational and superrational intuition.
When analyzed and defined inthis way subrational intuition will be found to be associated withvital impulse (élan vital) and superrational intuition with a powerof vital control (frein vital) over this impulse; and furthermoreit will be clear that this control must be exercised if men are tobe drawn towards a common centre, not in dreamland, but in the realworld.
So far then from its being true that the man who analyzes mustneeds see things in disconnection dead and spiritless, it is only byanalysis that he is, in an individualistic age, put on the pathway oftrue unity, and also of the rôle of the imagination in achieving thisunity.
For there is need to discriminate between the different typesof imagination no less than between the different types of intuition.
One will find through such analysis that the centre of normal humanexperience that is to serve as a check on impulse (so far at least asit is something distinct from the mere convention of one’s age andtime) can be apprehended only with the aid of the imagination.
This isonly another way of saying that the reality that is set above one’sordinary self is not a fixed absolute but can be glimpsed, if at all,only through a veil of illusion and is indeed inseparable from theillusion.
This realm of insight cannot be finally formulated for thesimple reason that it is anterior to formulæ.
It must therefore fromthe point of view of an intellect it transcends seem infinite though ina very different sense from the outer infinite of expansive desire.
This inner or human infinite, so far from being incompatible withdecorum, is the source of true decorum.
True decorum is only thepulling back and disciplining of impulse to the proportionateness thathas been perceived with the aid of what one may term the ethical orgeneralizing imagination.
To dismiss like the romantic expansionisteverything that limits or restricts the lust of knowledge or of poweror of sensation as arbitrary and artificial is to miss true decorum andat the same time to sink, as a Greek would say, from ethos to pathos.
If one is to avoid this error one must, as Hamlet counsels, “in thevery torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of passion, acquireand beget a temperance that may give it smoothness.
This is probablythe best of all modern definitions of decorum simply because it is themost experimental.
In general all that has been said about the ethicalimagination is not to be taken as a fine-spun theory, but as an attempthowever imperfect to give an account of actual experience.
One may report from observation another trait of truly ethical art, artwhich is at once imaginative and decorous.
It is not merely intense,as art that is imaginative at the expense of decorum may very wellbe,131 it has a restrained and humanized intensity--intensity on abackground of calm.
The presence of the ethical imagination whether inart or life132 is always known as an element of calm.
In art that has the ethical quality, and I am again not setting up ametaphysical theory but reporting from observation, the calm that comesfrom imaginative insight into the universal is inextricably blendedwith an element of uniqueness--with a something that belongs to aparticular time and place and individual.
The truth to the universal,as Aristotle would say, gives the work verisimilitude and the truthto the particular satisfies man’s deep-seated craving for novelty;so that the best art unites the probable with the wonderful.
Butthe probable, one cannot insist too often, is won no less than thewonderful with the aid of the imagination and so is of the very soulof art.
The romanticist who is ready to sacrifice the probable to thewonderful and to look on the whole demand for verisimilitude as anacademic superstition is prone to assume that he has a monopoly ofsoul and imagination.
But the word soul is at least in as much needof Socratic definition as the word intuition.
It is possible, forexample, with the aid of the ethical imagination so to partake of theultimate element of calm as to rise to the religious level.
The man whohas risen to this level has a soul, but it is a soul of peace.
Bothsoul and imagination are also needed to achieve the fine adjustmentand mediation of the humanist.
It is not enough, however, to have areligious or a humanistic soul if one is to be a creator or even afully equipped critic of art.
For art rests primarily not on ethicalbut æsthetic perception.
This perception itself varies widely accordingto the art involved.
One may, for instance, be musically perceptive andat the same time lack poetic perception.
To be a creator in any artone must possess furthermore the technique of this art--something thatis more or less separable from its “soul” in any sense of the word.
Itis possible to put a wildly romantic soul into art, as has often beendone in the Far East, and at the same time to be highly conventionalor traditional in one’s technique.
Writers like Mérimée, Renan, andMaupassant again are faithful in the main to the technique of Frenchprose that was worked out during the classical period, but combine withthis technique an utterly unclassical “soul.
Rules, especially perhaps rules as to what to avoid, may be of aid inacquiring technique, but are out of place in dealing with the soul ofart.
There one passes from rules to principles.
The only rule, if weare to achieve art that has an ethical soul, is to view life with somedegree of imaginative wholeness.
Art that has technique without soulin either the classical or romantic sense, and so fails either toinspire elevation or awaken wonder, is likely to be felt as a barrenvirtuosity.
The pseudo-classicist was often unduly minute in the ruleshe laid down for technique or outer form, as one may say, and thenignored the ethical imagination or inner form entirely, or else set upas a substitute mere didacticism.
Since pseudo-classic work of thistype plainly lacked soul and imagination, and since the romanticistfelt and felt rightly that he himself had a soul and imagination, heconcluded wrongly that soul and imagination are romantic monopolies.
Like the pseudo-classicist, he inclines to identify high seriousnessin art, something that can only come from the exercise of the ethicalimagination at its best, with mere preaching, only he differs fromthe pseudo-classicist in insisting that preaching should be left todivines.
One should insist, on the contrary, that the mark of genuinelyethical art, art that is highly serious, is that it is free frompreaching.
Sophocles is more ethical than Euripides for the simplereason that he views life with more imaginative wholeness.
At the sametime he is much less given to preaching than Euripides.
He does not, asFitzGerald says, interrupt the action and the exhibition of characterthrough action in order to “jaw philosophy.
It is not unusual for the modern artist to seek, like Euripides,to dissimulate the lack of true ethical purpose in his work byagitating various problems.
But problems come and go, whereas humannature abides.
One may agitate problems without number, and yetlack imaginative insight into the abiding element in human nature.
Moreover, not being of the soul of art, the problem that one agitatesis in danger of being a clogging intellectualism.
Furthermore to seekin problems an equivalent for the definition and purpose that theethical imagination alone can give is to renew, often in an aggravatedform, the neo-classical error.
The moralizing of the pseudo-classicdramatist, even though dull and misplaced, was usually sound enough initself; whereas the moralizing of those who seek nowadays to use thestage as a pulpit, resting as it does on false humanitarian postulates,is in itself dubious.
The problem play succeeds not infrequently inbeing at once dull and indecent.
The problem play is often very superior in technique or outer formto the earlier romantic drama, but it still suffers from the samelack of inner form, inasmuch as its social purpose cannot take theplace of true human purpose based on imaginative insight into theuniversal.
The lack of inner form in so much modern drama and art ingeneral can be traced to the original unsoundness of the break withpseudo-classic formalism.
To a pseudo-classic art that lacked everykind of perceptiveness the Rousseauist opposed æsthetic perceptiveness,and it is something, one must admit, thus to have discovered thesenses.
But to his æsthetic perceptiveness he failed, as I havealready said, to add ethical perceptiveness because of his inabilityto distinguish between ethical perceptiveness and mere didacticism,and so when asked to put ethical purpose into art he replied thatart should be pursued for its own sake (l’art pour l’art) andthat “beauty is its own excuse for being.
One should note herethe transformation that this pure æstheticism brought about in themeaning of the word beauty itself.
For the Greek beauty resided inproportion,133 and proportion can be attained only with the aid ofthe ethical imagination.
With the elimination of the ethical elementfrom the soul of art the result is an imagination that is free towander wild with the emancipated emotions.
The result is likely to beart in which a lively æsthetic perceptiveness is not subordinated toany whole, art that is unstructural, however it may abound in vivid andpicturesque details; and a one-sided art of this kind the romanticistdoes not hesitate to call beautiful.
If we let the reason sleep andare content to watch a succession of dissolving views,” says Mr. Eltonof Shelley’s “Revolt of Islam,” “the poem is seen at once to overflowwith beauty.
134 Mere reason is not strictly speaking a sufficientremedy for this unstructural type of “beauty.
Thus Chateaubriand’sreason is on the side of proportion and all the classical virtues buthis imagination is not (and we cannot repeat too often that it is whata man is imaginatively and not what he preaches that really counts).
Instead of siding with his reason and aiding it to ethical perceptionChateaubriand’s imagination is the free playmate of his emotions.
Whatdid I care for all these futilities” (i.
e.
his functions as cabinetminister), he exclaims, “I who never cared for anything except for mydreams, and even then on condition that they should last only for anight.
When a man has once spoken in that vein sensible people willpay little heed to what he preaches; for they will be certain that thedriving power of his work and personality is elsewhere.
The imaginationholds the balance of power between the reason and the perceptionsof sense, and Chateaubriand’s imagination is plainly on the side ofsensuous adventure.
This vagabondage of the imagination appearsespecially in his imagistic trend, in his pursuit of the descriptivedetail for its own sake.
To set out like Chateaubriand to restore themonarchy and the Christian religion and instead to become the founderof “l’école des images à tout prix” is an especially striking form ofthe contrast in romantic morality between the ideal and the real.
The attempt that we have been studying to divorce beauty from ethicsled in the latter part of the eighteenth century to the rise of anightmare subject,--æsthetics.
Shaftesbury indeed, as we have seenalready, anticipates the favorite romantic doctrine that beauty istruth and truth beauty, which means in practice to rest both truth andbeauty upon a fluid emotionalism.
Thus to deal æsthetically with truthis an error of the first magnitude, but it is also an error, thougha less serious one, to see only the æsthetic element in beauty.
Forbeauty to be complete must have not only æsthetic perceptiveness butorder and proportion; and this brings us back again to the problemof the ethical imagination and the permanent model or pattern withreference to which it seeks to impose measure and proportion uponsensuous perception and expansive desire.
We should not hesitate tosay that beauty loses most of its meaning when divorced from ethicseven though every æsthete in the world should arise and denounce us asphilistines.
To rest beauty upon feeling as the very name æstheticsimplies, is to rest it upon what is ever shifting.
Nor can we escapefrom this endless mobility with the aid of physical science, forphysical science does not itself rise above the naturalistic flux.
After eliminating from beauty the permanent pattern and the ethicalimagination with the aid of which it is perceived, a man will be readyto term beautiful anything that reflects his ordinary or temperamentalself.
Diderot is a sentimentalist and so he sees as much beauty in thesentimentalist Richardson as in Homer.
If a man is psychically restlesshe will see beauty only in motion.
The Italian futurist Marinetti saysthat for him a rushing motor car is more beautiful than the Victory ofSamothrace.
A complete sacrifice of the principle of repose in beauty(which itself arises from the presence of the ethical imagination)to the suggesting of motion such as has been seen in certain recentschools, runs practically into a mixture of charlatanism and madness.
He that is giddy thinks the world goes round,” says Shakespeare,and the exponents of certain ultra-modern movements in painting aresimply trying to paint their inner giddiness.
As a matter of fact thepretension of the æsthete to have a purely personal vision of beautyand then treat as a philistine every one who does not accept it, isintolerable.
Either beauty cannot be defined at all or we must saythat only is beautiful which seems so to the right kind of man, andthe right kind of man is plainly he whose total attitude towards lifeis correct, who views life with some degree of imaginative wholeness,which is only another way of saying that the problem of beauty isinseparable from the ethical problem.
In an absolute sense nobody cansee life steadily and see it whole; but we may at least move towardssteadiness and wholeness.
The æsthete is plainly moving in an oppositedirection; he is becoming more and more openly a votary of the godWhirl.
His lack of inner form is an error not of æsthetics but ofgeneral philosophy.
The romantic imagination, the imagination that is not drawn back toany ethical centre and so is free to wander wild in its own empire ofchimeras, has indeed a place in life.
To understand what this placeis one needs to emphasize the distinction between art that has highseriousness and art that is merely recreative.
The serious moments oflife are moments of tension, of concentration on either the natural orthe human law.
But Apollo cannot always be bending the bow.
Man needsat times to relax, and one way of relaxing is to take refuge for atime in some land of chimeras, to follow the Arcadian gleam.
He maythen come back to the real world, the world of active effort, solacedand refreshed.
But it is only with reference to some ethical centrethat we may determine what art is soundly recreative, in what formsof adventure the imagination may innocently indulge.
The romanticistshould recollect that among other forms of adventure is what Ben Jonsonterms “a bold adventure for hell”; and that a not uncommon nostalgiais what the French call la nostalgie de la boue--man’s nostalgia forhis native mud.
Because we are justified at times, as Lamb urges, inwandering imaginatively beyond “the diocese of strict conscience,” itdoes not follow that we may, like him, treat Restoration Comedy as asort of fairyland; for Restoration Comedy is a world not of pure but ofimpure imagination.
Lamb’s paradox, however, is harmless compared with what we have justbeen seeing in Chateaubriand.
With a dalliant imagination that entitleshim at best to play a recreative rôle, he sets up as a religiousteacher.
Michelet again has been described as an “entertainer whobelieves himself a prophet,” and this description fits many otherRousseauists.
The æsthete who assumes an apocalyptic pose is anespecially flagrant instance of the huddling together of incompatibledesires.
He wishes to sport with Amaryllis in the shade and at the sametime enjoy the honors that belong only to the man who scorns delightsand lives laborious days.
For the exercise of the ethical imagination,it is hardly necessary to say, involves effort.
Perhaps no one hasever surpassed Rousseau himself in the art of which I have alreadyspoken,--that of giving to moral indolence a semblance of profoundphilosophy.
One cannot indeed always affirm that the Rousseauist is by the qualityof his imagination an entertainer pure and simple.
His breaking down ofbarriers and running together of the planes of being results at timesin ambiguous mixtures--gleams of insight that actually seem to ministerto fleshliness.
One may cite as an example the “voluptuous religiosity”that certain critics have discovered in Wagner.
The romanticist will at once protest against the application of ethicalstandards to Wagner or any other musician.
Music, he holds, is themost soulful of the arts and so the least subject to ethics.
For thesame reason it is the chief of arts and also--in view of the fact thatromanticists have a monopoly of soul--the most romantic.
One should notallow to pass unchallenged this notion that because music is filledwith soul it is therefore subject to no ethical centre, but should betreated as a pure enchantment.
The Greeks were as a matter of fact muchconcerned with the ethical quality of music.
Certain musical modes, theDoric for example, had as they believed a virile “soul,” other modeslike the Lydian had the contrary (“Lap me in soft Lydian airs”).
Forthe very reason that music is the most appealing of the arts (song,says Aristotle, is the sweetest of all things) they were especiallyanxious that this art should be guarded from perversion.
135 Withoutattempting a full discussion of a difficult subject for which I haveno competency, it will be enough to point out that the plain song thatprevailed in Christian churches for over a thousand years evidently hada very different “soul,” a soul that inspired to prayer and peace, frommuch specifically romantic music that has a soul of restlessness, ofinfinite indeterminate desire.
The result of the failure to recognizethis distinction is very often a hybrid art.
Berlioz showed a ratherpeculiar conception of religion when he took pride in the fact that hisRequiem (!) Mass frightened one of the listeners into a fit.
The ethical confusion that arises from the romantic cult of “soul” andthe closely allied tendency towards a hybrid art--art that lacks highseriousness without being frankly recreative--may also be illustratedfrom the field of poetry.
Many volumes have been published and arestill being published on Browning as a philosophic and religiousteacher.
But Browning can pass as a prophet only with the half-educatedperson, the person who has lost traditional standards and has at thesame time failed to work out with the aid of the ethical imaginationsome fresh scale of values and in the meanwhile lives impulsively andglorifies impulse.
Like the half-educated person, Browning is capableof almost any amount of intellectual and emotional subtlety, and likethe half-educated person he is deficient in inner form: that is hedeals with experience impressionistically without reference to anycentral pattern or purpose.
136 It is enough that the separate momentsof this experience should each stand forth like              The quick sharp scratch    And blue spurt of a lighted match.
One may take as an illustration of this drift towards the melodramaticthe “Ring and the Book.
The method of this poem is peripheral, thatis, the action is viewed not from any centre but as refracted throughthe temperaments of the actors.
The twelve monologues of which thepoem is composed illustrate the tendency of romantic writing to runinto some “song of myself” or “tale of my heart.
The “Ring and theBook” is not only off the centre, but is designed to raise a positiveprejudice against everything that is central.
Guido, for example, hadobserved decorum, had done all the conventional things and is horrible.
Pompilia, the beautiful soul, had the great advantage of having hadan indecorous start.
Being the daughter of a drab, she is not keptfrom heeding the voice of nature.
Caponsacchi again shows the beautyof his soul by violating the decorum of the priesthood.
This leastrepresentative of priests wins our sympathy, not by his Christianity,but by his lyrical intensity:    O lyric love, half angel and half bird,    And all a wonder and a wild desire!Browning here escapes for once from the clogging intellectualism thatmakes nearly all the “Ring and the Book” an indeterminate blend ofverse and prose, and achieves true poetry though not of the highesttype.
The hybrid character of his art, due partly to a lack of outerform, to a defective poetical technique, arises even more from a lackof inner form--from an attempt to give a semblance of seriousness towhat is at bottom unethical.
The aged Pope may well meditate on therevolution that is implied in the substitution of the morality of thebeautiful soul for that of St.
Augustine.
137 In seeming to acceptthis revolution Browning’s Pope comes near to breaking all records,even in the romantic movement, for paradox and indecorum.
At bottom the war between humanist and romanticist is so irreconcilablebecause the one is a mediator and the other an extremist.
Browningwould have us admire his Pompilia because her love knows no limit;138but a secular love like hers must know a limit, must be decorous inshort, if it is to be distinguished from mere emotional intensity.
It is evident that the romantic ideal of art for art’s sake meant inthe real world art for sensation’s sake.
The glorification of a loveknowing no limit, that a Browning or a Hugo sets up as a substitute forphilosophy and even for religion, is therefore closely affiliated inpractice with the libido sentiendi.
It is hard,” wrote Stendhal, in1817, “not to see what the nineteenth century desires.
A love of strongemotions is its true character.
The romantic tendency to push everyemotion to an extreme, regardless of decorum, is not much affected bywhat the romanticist preaches or by the problems he agitates.
Doudanremarks of a mother who loses her child in Hugo’s “Nôtre Dame deParis,” that “her rage after this loss has nothing to equal it in theroarings of a lioness or tigress who has been robbed of her young.
Shebecomes vulgar by excess of despair.
It is the saturnalia of maternalgrief.
You see that this woman belongs to a world in which neither theinstincts nor the passions have that divine aroma which imposes on themsome kind of measure--the dignity or decorum that contains a moralprinciple; … When the passions no longer have this check, they shouldbe relegated to the menagerie along with leopards and rhinoceroses,and, strange circumstance, when the passions do recognize this checkthey produce more effect on the spectators than unregulated outbursts;they give evidence of more depth.
This superlativeness, as one maysay, that Hugo displays in his picture of maternal grief is notconfined to the emotional romanticist.
It appears, for example, amongthe intellectual romanticists of the seventeenth century and affectedthe very forms of language.
Molière and others ridiculed the adjectivesand adverbs with which the précieuses sought to express their specialtype of superlativeness and intensity (extrêmement, furieusement,terriblement, etc.
Alfred de Musset’s assertion that the chiefdifference between classicist and romanticist is found in the latter’sgreater proneness to adjectives is not altogether a jest.
It has beensaid that the pessimist uses few, the optimist many adjectives; but theuse of adjectives and above all of superlatives would rather seem togrow with one’s expansiveness, and no movement was ever more expansivethan that we are studying.
Dante, according to Rivarol, is very sparingof adjectives.
His sentence tends to maintain itself by the verband substantive alone.
In this as in other respects Dante is at theopposite pole from the expansionist.
The romantic violence of expression is at once a proof of “soul” anda protest against the tameness and smugness of the pseudo-classicist.
The human volcano must overflow at times in a lava of molten words.
Damnation!” cries Berlioz, “I could crush a red-hot iron between myteeth.
139 The disproportion between the outer incident and theemotion that the Rousseauist expends on it is often ludicrous.
140The kind of force that the man attains who sees in emotional intensitya mark of spiritual distinction, and deems moderation identical withmediocrity, is likely to be the force of delirium or fever.
What onesees in “Werther,” says Goethe himself, is weakness seeking to giveitself the prestige of strength; and this remark goes far.
There is insome of the romanticists a suggestion not merely of spiritual but ofphysical anæmia.
141 Still the intensity is often that of a strongbut unbridled spirit.
Pleasure is pushed to the point where it runsover into pain, and pain to the point where it becomes an auxiliaryof pleasure.
The âcre baiser of the “Nouvelle Héloïse” that soscandalized Voltaire presaged even more than a literary revolution.
Thepoems of A.
de Musset in particular contain an extraordinary perversionof the Christian doctrine of purification through suffering.
Thereis something repellent to the genuine Christian as well as to theworldling in what one is tempted to call Musset’s Epicurean cult ofpain.
142Moments of superlative intensity whether of pleasure or pain mustin the nature of the case be brief--mere spasms or paroxysms; andone might apply to the whole school the term paroxyst and spasmodistassumed by certain minor groups during the past century.
TheRousseauist is in general loath to rein in his emotional vehemence, toimpair the zest with which he responds to the solicitations of sense,by any reference to the “future and sum of time,” by any reference,that is, to an ethical purpose.
He would enjoy his thrill pure andunalloyed, and this amounts in practice to the pursuit of the beautifulor sensation-crowded moment.
Saint-Preux says of the days spent withJulie that a “sweet ecstasy” absorbed “their whole duration andgathered it together in a point like that of eternity.
There was forme neither past nor future, and I enjoyed at one and the same time thedelights of a thousand centuries.
143 The superlativist one mightsuppose could go no further.
But in the deliberate sacrifice of allethical values to the beautiful moment Browning has perhaps improvedeven on Rousseau:        Truth, that’s brighter than gem,        Trust, that’s purer than pearl,--    Brightest truth, purest trust in the universe--all were for me        In the kiss of one girl.
Browning entitles the poem from which I am quoting Summum Bonum.
Thesupreme good it would appear is identical with the supreme thrill.
I have already said enough to make clear that the title of thischapter and the last is in a way a misnomer.
There is no such thingas romantic morality.
The innovations in ethics that are due toromanticism reduce themselves on close scrutiny to a vast system ofnaturalistic camouflage.
To understand how this camouflage has beenso successful one needs to connect Rousseauism with the Baconianmovement.
Scientific progress had inspired man with a new confidencein himself at the same time that the positive and critical methodby which it had been achieved detached him from the past and itstraditional standards of good and evil.
To break with tradition onsound lines one needs to apply the utmost keenness of analysis notmerely to the natural but to the human law.
But man’s analytical powerswere very much taken up with the new task of mastering the naturallaw, so much so that he seemed incapable of further analytical effort,but longed rather for relaxation from his sustained concentration ofintellect and imagination on the physical order.
At the same timehe was so elated by the progress he was making in this order thathe was inclined to assume a similar advance on the moral plane andto believe that this advance could also be achieved collectively.
Acollective salvation of this kind without any need of a concentrationof the intellect and imagination is precisely what was opened up tohim by the Rousseauistic “ideal” of brotherhood.
This “ideal,” as Ihave tried to show, was only a projection of the Arcadian imaginationon the void.
But in the abdication of analysis and critical judgment,which would have reduced it to a purely recreative rôle, this Arcadiandreaming was enabled to set up as a serious philosophy, and to expandinto innumerable Utopias.
Many who might have taken alarm at thehumanitarian revolution in ethics were reassured by the very fervorwith which its promoters continued to utter the old words--conscience,virtue, etc.
No one puts more stress than Rousseau himself onconscience, while in the very act of transforming conscience from aninner check into an expansive emotion.
We have seen that as a result of this transformation of conscience,temperament is emancipated from both inner and outer control and thatthis emancipation tends in the real world to the rise of two maintypes--the Bohemian and the superman, both unprimitive, inasmuch asprimitive man is governed not by temperament but by convention; andthat what actually tends to prevail in such a temperamental worldin view of the superior “hardness” of the superman, is the law ofcunning and the law of force.
So far as the Rousseauists set up themere emancipation of temperament as a serious philosophy, they areto be held responsible for the results of this emancipation whetherdisplayed in the lust of power or the lust of sensation.
But thelust of power and the lust of sensation, such as they appear, forexample, in the so-called realism of the later nineteenth century, arenot in themselves identical with romanticism.
Many of the realists,like Flaubert, as I have already pointed out, are simply bitter anddisillusioned Rousseauists who are expressing their nausea at thesociety that has actually arisen from the emancipation of temperamentin themselves and others.
The essence of Rousseauistic as of otherromance, I may repeat, is to be found not in any mere fact, not evenin the fact of sensation, but in a certain quality of the imagination.
Rousseauism is, it is true, an emancipation of impulse, especially ofthe impulse of sex.
Practically all the examples I have chosen of thetense and beautiful moment are erotic.
But what one has even here, asthe imagination grows increasingly romantic, is less the reality thanthe dream of the beautiful moment, an intensity that is achieved onlyin the tower of ivory.
This point can be made clear only by a fullerstudy of the romantic conception of love.
CHAPTER VIROMANTIC LOVEWhat first strikes one in Rousseau’s attitude towards love is theseparation, even wider here perhaps than elsewhere, between the idealand the real.
He dilates in the “Confessions” on the difference ofthe attachment that he felt when scarcely more than a boy for twoyoung women of Geneva, Mademoiselle Vulson and Mademoiselle Goton.
Hisattachment for the latter was real in a sense that Zola would haveunderstood.
His attachment for Mademoiselle Vulson reminds one ratherof that of a mediæval knight for his lady.
The same contrast runsthrough Rousseau’s life.
Seamstresses, chambermaids, shop-girls,” hesays, “attracted me very little.
I had to have fine ladies.
144 Somuch for the ideal; the real was Thérèse Levasseur.
We are not to suppose that Rousseau’s love even when most ideal isreally exalted above the fleshly level.
Byron indeed says of Rousseauthat “his was not the love of living dame but of ideal beauty,” andif this were strictly true Rousseau might be accounted a Platonist.
But any particular beautiful object is for Plato only a symbol oradumbration of a supersensuous beauty; so that an earthly love can beat best only a stepping-stone to the Uranian Aphrodite.
The terrestrialand the heavenly loves are not in short run together, whereas theessence of Rousseauistic love is this very blending.
Rousseau,” saysJoubert, “had a voluptuous mind.
In his writings the soul is alwaysmingled with the body and never distinct from it.
No one has everrendered more vividly the impression of the flesh touching the spiritand the delights of their marriage.
I need not, however, repeat herewhat I have said elsewhere145 about this confusion of the planes ofbeing, perhaps the most important aspect of romantic love.
Though Rousseau is not a true Platonist in his treatment of love, hedoes, as I have said, recall at times the cult of the mediæval knightfor his lady.
One may even find in mediæval love something that isremotely related to Rousseau’s contrast between the ideal and theactual; for in its attitude towards woman as in other respects theMiddle Ages tended to be extreme.
Woman is either depressed below thehuman level as the favorite instrument of the devil in man’s temptation(mulier hominis confusio), or else exalted above this level as themother of God.
The figure of Mary blends sense and spirit in a way thatis foreign to Plato and the ancients.
As Heine says very profanely,the Virgin was a sort of heavenly dame du comptoir whose celestialsmile drew the northern barbarians into the Church.
Sense was thuspressed into the service of spirit at the risk of a perilous confusion.
The chivalric cult of the lady has obvious points of contact with theworship of the Madonna.
The knight who is raised from one height ofperfection to another by the light of his lady’s eyes is also pressingsense into the service of spirit with the same risk that the processmay be reversed.
The reversal actually takes place in Rousseau and hisfollowers: spirit is pressed into the service of sense in such wise asto give to sense a sort of infinitude.
Baudelaire pays his homage to aParisian grisette in the form of a Latin canticle to the Virgin.
146The perversion of mediæval love is equally though not quite soobviously present in many other Rousseauists.
I have said that the Middle Ages inclined to the extreme; mediævalwriters are, however, fond of insisting on “measure”; and thisis almost inevitable in view of the large amount of classical,especially Aristotelian, survival throughout this period.
But the twodistinctively mediæval types, the saint and the knight, are neitherof them mediators.
They stand, however, on an entirely differentfooting as regards the law of measure.
Not even Aristotle himself wouldmaintain that the law of measure applies to saintliness, and in generalto the religious realm.
The saint in so far as he is saintly hasundergone conversion, has in the literal sense of the word faced aroundand is looking in an entirely different direction from that to whichthe warnings “nothing too much” and “think as a mortal” apply.
Verydifferent psychic elements may indeed appear in any particular saint.
Abook has been published recently on the “Romanticism of St.
Francis.
The truth seems to be that though St.
Francis had his romantic side,he was even more religious than romantic.
One may affirm with someconfidence of another mediæval figure, Peter the Hermit, that he was,on the other hand, much more romantic than religious.
For all theinformation we have tends to show that he was a very restless personand a man’s restlessness is ordinarily in inverse ratio to his religion.
If the saint transcends in a way the law of measure, the knight onthe other hand should be subject to it.
For courage and the love ofwoman--his main interests in life--belong not to the religious butto the secular realm.
But in his conception of love and courage theknight was plainly not a mediator but an extremist: he was hauntedby the idea of adventure, of a love and courage that transcend thebounds not merely of the probable but of the possible.
His imaginationis romantic in the sense I have tried to define--it is straining,that is, beyond the confines of the real.
Ruskin’s violent diatribeagainst Cervantes147 for having killed “idealism” by his ridiculeof these knightly exaggerations, is in itself absurd, but interestingas evidence of the quality of Ruskin’s own imagination.
Like otherromanticists I have cited, he seems to have been not unaware of his ownkinship to Don Quixote.
The very truth about either the mediæval ormodern forms of romantic love--love which is on the secular level andat the same time sets itself above the law of measure--was uttered byDr.
Johnson in his comment on the heroic plays of Dryden: “By admittingthe romantic omnipotence of love he has recommended as laudable andworthy of imitation that conduct which through all ages the good havecensured as vicious and the bad have despised as foolish.
The man of the Middle Ages, however extravagant in his imaginings,was often no doubt terrestrial enough in his practice.
The troubadourwho addressed his high-flown fancies to some fair châtelaine (usuallya married woman) often had relations in real life not unlike thoseof Rousseau with Thérèse Levasseur.
Some such contrast indeed betweenthe “ideal” and the “real” existed in the life of one of Rousseau’sfavorite poets, Petrarch.
The lover may, however, run together theideal and the real.
He may glorify some comparatively commonplaceperson, crown as queen of his heart some Dulcinea del Toboso.
Hazlittemploys appropriately in describing his own passion for the vulgardaughter of a London boarding-house keeper the very words of Cervantes:“He had courted a statue, hunted the wind, cried aloud to the desert.
Hazlitt like other lovers of this type is in love not with a particularperson but with his own dream.
He is as one may say in love with love.
No subject indeed illustrates like this of love the nostalgia, theinfinite indeterminate desire of the romantic imagination.
Something ofthis diffusive longing no doubt came into the world with Christianity.
There is a wide gap between the sentence of St.
Augustine that Shelleyhas taken as epigraph for his “Alastor”148 and the spirit of thegreat Greek and Roman classics.
Yet such is the abiding vitality ofGreek mythology that one finds in Greece perhaps the best symbol ofthe romantic lover.
Rousseau could not fail to be attracted by thestory of Pygmalion and Galatea.
His lyrical “monodrama” in poeticalprose, “Pygmalion,” is important not only for its literary but for itsmusical influence.
The Germans in particular (including the youthfulGoethe) were fascinated.
To the mature Goethe Rousseau’s account of thesculptor who became enamored of his own creation and breathed into itactual life by the sheer intensity of his desire seemed a deliriousconfusion of the planes of being, an attempt to drag ideal beauty downto the level of sensuous realization.
But a passion thus conceivedexactly satisfies the romantic requirement.
For though the romanticistwishes to abandon himself to the rapture of love, he does not wish totranscend his own ego.
The object with which Pygmalion is in love isafter all only a projection of his own “genius.
But such an object isnot in any proper sense an object at all.
There is in fact no object inthe romantic universe--only subject.
This subjective love amounts inpractice to a use of the imagination to enhance emotional intoxication,or if one prefers, to the pursuit of illusion for its own sake.
This lack of definite object appears just as clearly in the Germansymbol of romantic love--the blue flower.
The blue flower resolvesitself at last, it will be remembered, into a fair feminineface149--a face that cannot, however, be overtaken.
The colortypifies the blue distance in which it always loses itself, “thenever-ending quest after the ever-fleeting object of desire.
Theobject is thus elusive because, as I have said, it is not, properlyspeaking, an object at all but only a dalliance of the imaginationwith its own dream.
Cats, says Rivarol, do not caress us, they caressthemselves upon us.
But though cats may suffer from what the newrealist calls the egocentric predicament, they can scarcely vie in thesubtle involutions of their egoism with the romantic lover.
Besidescreating the symbol of the blue flower, Novalis treats romantic lovein his unfinished tale “The Disciples at Saïs.
He contemplated twoendings to this tale--in the one, when the disciple lifts the veilof the inmost sanctuary of the temple at Saïs, Rosenblütchen (theequivalent of the blue flower) falls into his arms.
In the secondversion what he sees when he lifts the mysterious veil is--“wonder ofwonders--himself.
The two endings are in substance the same.
The story of Novalis’s attachment for a fourteen-year-old girl, Sophievon Kühn, and of his plans on her death for a truly romantic suicide--aswooning away into the night--and then of the suddenness with whichhe transferred his dream to another maiden, Julie von Charpentier,is familiar.
If Sophie had lived and Novalis had lived and they hadwedded, he might conceivably have made her a faithful husband, but shewould no longer have been the blue flower, the ideal.
For one’s loveis for something infinitely remote; it is as Shelley says, in what isperhaps the most perfect expression of romantic longing:    The desire of the moth for the star,      Of the night for the morrow,    The devotion to something afar      From the sphere of our sorrow.
The sphere of Shelley’s sorrow at the time he wrote these lines to Mrs.
Williams was Mary Godwin.
In the time of Harriet Westbrook, Mary hadbeen the “star.
The romantic lover often feigns in explanation of his nostalgiathat in some previous existence he had been enamored of a nymph--anEgeria--or a woman transcending the ordinary mould--“some Lilith orHelen or Antigone.
150 Shelley inquires eagerly in one of his lettersabout the new poem by Horace Smith, “The Nympholept.
In the somewhatunclassical sense that the term came to have in the romantic movement,Shelley is himself the perfect example of the nympholept.
In thisrespect as in others, however, he merely continues Rousseau.
If it hadnot been for some memories of my youth and Madame d’Houdetot,” saysJean-Jacques, “the loves that I have felt and described would have beenonly with sylphids.
151Chateaubriand speaks with aristocratic disdain of Rousseau’s Venetianamours, but on the “ideal” side he is not only his follower but perhapsthe supreme French example of nympholepsy.
He describes his lady ofdreams sometimes like Rousseau as the “sylphid,” sometimes as his“phantom of love.
He had been haunted by this phantom almost from hischildhood.
Even then I glimpsed that to love and be loved in a waythat was unknown to me was destined to be my supreme felicity.
As aresult of the ardor of my imagination, my timidity and solitude, I didnot turn to the outer world, but was thrown back upon myself.
In theabsence of a real object, I evoked by the power of my vague desires aphantom that was never to leave me.
To those who remember the closelyparallel passages in Rousseau, Chateaubriand will seem to exaggeratethe privilege of the original genius to look on himself as unique whenhe adds: “I do not know whether the history of the human heart offersanother example of this nature.
152 The pursuit of this phantom oflove gives the secret key to Chateaubriand’s life.
He takes refuge inthe American wilderness in order that he may have in this primitiveArcadia a more spacious setting for his dream.
153If one wishes to see how very similar these nympholeptic experiencesare not only from individual to individual, but from country tocountry, one has only to compare the passages I have just been quotingfrom Chateaubriand with Shelley’s “Epipsychidion.
Shelley writes ofhis own youth:    There was a Being whom my spirit oft    Met on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,    In the clear golden prime of my youth’s dawn,    Upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,    Amid the enchanted mountains, and the caves    Of divine sleep, and on the air-like waves    Of wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor    Paved her light steps; on an imagined shore,    Under the gray beak of some promontory    She met me, robed in such exceeding glory,    That I beheld her not, etc.
At the time of writing “Epipsychidion” the magic vision happened tohave coalesced for the moment with Emilia Viviani, though destined soonto flit elsewhere.
Shelley invites his “soul’s sister,” the idyllic“she,” who is at bottom only a projection of his own imagination, toset sail with him for Arcady.
Epipsychidion,” indeed, might be used asa manual to illustrate the difference between mere Arcadian dreamingand a true Platonism.
Chateaubriand is ordinarily and rightly compared with Byron ratherthan with Shelley.
He is plainly, however, far more of a nympholeptthan Byron.
Mr. Hilary, indeed, in Peacock’s “Nightmare Abbey” saysto Mr. Cypress (Byron): “You talk like a Rosicrucian, who will lovenothing but a sylph, who does not believe in the existence of a sylph,and who yet quarrels with the whole universe for not containing asylph.
154 Certain distinctions would have to be made if one wereattempting a complete study of love in Byron; yet after all the love ofDon Juan and Haidée is one that Sappho or Catullus or Burns would haveunderstood; and these poets were not nympholepts.
They were capableof burning with love, but not, as Rousseau says of himself, “withoutany definite object.
155 Where Chateaubriand has some resemblanceto Byron is in his actual libertinism.
He is however nearer thanByron to the libertine of the eighteenth century--to the Lovelace whopushes the pursuit of pleasure to its final exasperation where itbecomes associated with the infliction of pain.
Few things are strangerthan the blend in Chateaubriand of this Sadic fury156 with the newromantic revery.
Indeed almost every type of egotism that may manifestitself in the relations of the sexes and that pushed to the superlativepitch, will be found in this theoretical classicist and champion ofChristianity.
Perhaps no more frenzied cry has ever issued from humanlips than that uttered by Atala157 in describing her emotions whentorn between her religious vow and her love for Chactas: “What dreamdid not arise in this heart overwhelmed with sorrow.
At times in fixingmy eyes upon you, I went so far as to form desires as insensate asthey were guilty; at one moment I seemed to wish that you and I werethe only living creatures upon the earth; and then again, feeling adivinity that held me back in my horrible transports, I seemed to wantthis divinity to be annihilated provided that clasped in your arms Ishould roll from abyss to abyss with the ruins of God and the world.
Longing is here pushed to a pitch where it passes over, as in Wagner’s“Tristan and Isolde,” into the desire for annihilation.
Actual libertinism is no necessary concomitant of nympholeptic longing.
There is a striking difference in this respect between Poe, forexample, and his translator and disciple, Baudelaire.
Nothing could beless suggestive of voluptuousness than Poe’s nostalgia.
His ecstasy,”says Stedman, “is that of the nympholept seeking an evasive being ofwhom he has glimpses by moonlight, starlight, even fenlight, but neverby noonday.
The embodiments of his dream that flit through his talesand poems, enhanced his popularity with the ultra-romantic public inFrance.
These strange apparitions nearly all of whom are epileptic,cataleptic, or consumptive made a natural appeal to a school that wasknown among its detractors as l’école poitrinaire.
Tender souls,”says Gautier, “were specially touched by Poe’s feminine figures, sovaporous, so transparent and of an almost spectral beauty.
Perhapsthe nympholepsy of Gérard de Nerval is almost equally vaporous andethereal.
He pursued through various earthly forms the queen of Shebawhom he had loved in a previous existence and hanged himself at lastwith what he believed to be her garter: an interesting example of therelation between the extreme forms of the romantic imagination andmadness.
158The pursuit of a phantom of love through various earthly forms ledin the course of the romantic movement to certain modificationsin a famous legend--that of Don Juan.
What is emphasized in theolder Don Juan is not merely his libertinism but his impiety--thegratification of his appetite in deliberate defiance of God.
He isanimated by Satanic pride, by the lust of power as well as by the lustof sensation.
In Molière’s treatment of the legend we can also seethe beginnings of the philanthropic pose.
159 With the progress ofRousseauism Don Juan tends to become an “idealist,” to seek to satisfyin his amorous adventures not merely his senses but his “soul” and histhirst for the “infinite.
160 Along with this idealistic Don Juan wealso see appearing at a very early stage in the movement the exoticDon Juan who wishes to have a great deal of strangeness added to hisbeauty.
In his affair with the “Floridiennes,” Chateaubriand shows theway to a long series of exotic lovers.
I said to my heart between sleeping and waking,    Thou wild thing that always art leaping or aching,    What black, brown or fair, in what clime, in what nation,    By turns has not taught thee a pit-a-pat-ation?These lines are so plainly meant for Pierre Loti that one learnswith surprise that they were written about 1724 by the Earl ofPeterborough.
161Byron’s Don Juan is at times exotic in his tastes, but, as I havesaid, he is not on the whole very nympholeptic--much less so than theDon Juan of Alfred de Musset, for example.
Musset indeed suggests inmany respects a less masculine Byron--Mademoiselle Byron as he hasbeen called.
In one whole side of his art as well as his treatmentof love he simply continues like Byron the eighteenth century.
Butfar more than Byron he aspires to ideal and absolute passion; so thatthe Musset of the “Nuits” is rightly regarded as one of the supremeembodiments, and at the same time the chief martyr, of the romanticreligion of love.
The outcome of his affair with George Sand maysymbolize fitly the wrecking of thousands of more obscure lives by thismortal chimera.
Musset and George Sand sought to come together, yetwhat they each sought in love is what the original genius seeks in allthings--self-expression.
What Musset saw in George Sand was not thereal woman but only his own dream.
But George Sand was not content thusto reflect back passively to Musset his ideal.
She was rather a Galateawhose ambition it was to create her own Pygmalion.
Your chimera isbetween us,” Musset exclaims; but his chimera was between them too.
The more Titan and Titaness try to meet, the more each is driven backinto the solitude of his own ego.
They were in love with love ratherthan with one another: and to be thus in love with love means on thelast analysis to be in love with one’s own emotions.
To love,” saysMusset, “is the great point.
What matters the mistress? What mattersthe flagon provided one have the intoxication?”162 He then proceedsto carry a love of this quality up into the presence of God and topresent it to him as his justification for having lived.
The art ofspeaking in tones of religious consecration of what is in its essenceegoistic has never been carried further than by the Rousseauisticromanticist.
God is always appearing at the most unexpectedmoments.
163 The highest of which man is capable apparently is to putan uncurbed imagination into the service of an emancipated temperament.
The credo that Perdican recites at the end of the second act of “On nebadine pas avec l’Amour”164 throws light on this point.
Men and womenaccording to this credo are filled with every manner of vileness, yetthere is something “sacred and sublime,” and that is the union of twoof these despicable beings.
The confusion of ethical values here is so palpable as scarcely to callfor comment.
It is precisely when men and women set out to love withthis degree of imaginative and emotional unrestraint that they cometo deserve all the opprobrious epithets Musset heaps upon them.
Thisradiant apotheosis of love and the quagmire in which it actually landsone is, as I have said, the whole subject of “Madame Bovary.
I shallneed to return to this particular disproportion between the ideal andthe real when I take up the subject of romantic melancholy.
The romantic lover who identifies the ideal with the superlative thrillis turning the ideal into something very transitory.
If the summumbonum is as Browning avers the “kiss of one girl,” the summum bonumis lost almost as soon as found.
The beautiful moment may however beprolonged in revery.
The romanticist may brood over it in the tower ofivory, and when thus enriched by being steeped in his temperament itmay become more truly his own than it was in reality.
Objects makeless impression upon me than my memory of them,” says Rousseau.
He isindeed the great master of what has been termed the art of impassionedrecollection.
This art is far from being confined in its applicationto love, though it may perhaps be studied here to the best advantage.
Rousseau, one should note, had very little intellectual memory, butan extraordinarily keen memory of images and sensations.
He couldnot, as he tells us in the “Confessions,” learn anything by heart,but he could recall with perfect distinctness what he had eaten forbreakfast about thirty years before.
In general he recalls his pastfeelings with a clearness and detail that are perhaps more femininethan masculine.
He seems,” says Hazlitt, one of his chief disciplesin the art of impassioned recollection, “to gather up the past momentsof his being like drops of honey-dew to distil a precious liquor fromthem; his alternate pleasures and pains are the bead-roll that he tellsover and piously worships; he makes a rosary of the flowers of hopeand fancy that strewed his earliest years.
165 This highly developedemotional memory is closely associated with the special quality of theromantic imagination--its cult of Arcadian illusion and the wistfulbackward glance to the vanished paradise of childhood and youth whenillusion was most spontaneous.
Let me still recall these memories,”says Hazlitt, “that they may breathe fresh life into me, and that Imay live that birthday of thought and romantic pleasure over again!Talk of the ideal! This is the only true ideal--the heavenly tintsof Fancy reflected in the bubbles that float upon the spring-tide ofhuman life.
166 Hazlitt converts criticism itself into an art ofimpassioned recollection.
He loves to linger over the beautiful momentsof his own literary life.
The passing years have increased the richnessof their temperamental refraction and bestowed upon them the “pathos ofdistance.
A good example is his account of the two years of his youthhe spent in reading the “Confessions” and the “Nouvelle Héloïse,” andin shedding tears over them.
They were the happiest years of our life.
We may well say of them, sweet is the dew of their memory and pleasantthe balm of their recollection.
167Rousseau’s own Arcadian memories are usually not of reading, likeHazlitt’s, but of actual incidents, though he does not hesitate toalter these incidents freely, as in his account of his stay at LesCharmettes, and to accommodate them to his dream.
He neglected the realMadame de Warens at the very time that he cherished his recollection ofher because this recollection was the idealized image of his own youth.
The yearning that he expresses at the beginning of his fragmentaryTenth Promenade, written only a few weeks before his death, is for thisidyllic period rather than for an actual woman.
168 A happy memory,says Musset, repeating Rousseau, is perhaps more genuine than happinessitself.
Possibly the three best known love poems of Lamartine, Musset,and Hugo respectively--“Le Lac,” “Souvenir,” and “La Tristessed’Olympio,” all hinge upon impassioned recollection and derive verydirectly from Rousseau.
Lamartine in particular has caught in the “LeLac” the very cadence of Rousseau’s reveries.
169Impassioned recollection may evidently be an abundant source of genuinepoetry, though not, it must be insisted, of the highest poetry.
Thepredominant rôle that it plays in Rousseau and many of his followersis simply a sign of an unduly dalliant imagination.
Experience afterall has other uses than to supply furnishings for the tower of ivory;it should control the judgment and guide the will; it is in short thenecessary basis of conduct.
The greater a man’s moral seriousness,the more he will be concerned with doing rather than dreaming (andI include right meditation among the forms of doing).
He will alsodemand an art and literature that reflect this his main preoccupation.
Between Wordsworth’s definition of poetry as “emotion recollected intranquillity,” and Aristotle’s definition of poetry as the imitationof human action according to probability or necessity, a wide gapplainly opens.
One may prefer Aristotle’s definition to that ofWordsworth and yet do justice to the merits of Wordsworth’s actualpoetical performance.
Nevertheless the tendency to put prime emphasison feeling instead of action shown in the definition is closely relatedto Wordsworth’s failure not only in dramatic but in epic poetry, in allpoetry in short that depends for its success on an element of plot andsustained narrative.
A curious extension of the art of impassioned recollection shouldreceive at least passing mention.
It has been so extended as to leadto what one may term an unethical use of literature and history.
Whatmen have done in the past and the consequences of this doing shouldsurely serve to throw some light on what men should do under similarcircumstances in the present.
But the man who turns his own personalexperience into mere dalliance may very well assume a like dalliantattitude towards the larger experience of the race.
This experiencemay merely provide him with pretexts for revery.
This narcotic use ofliterature and history, this art of creating for one’s self an alibi asTaine calls it, is nearly as old as the romantic movement.
The recordof the past becomes a gorgeous pageant that lures one to endlessimaginative exploration and lulls one to oblivion of everything exceptits variety and picturesqueness.
It becomes everything in fact except aschool of judgment.
One may note in connection with this use of historythe usual interplay between scientific and emotional naturalism.
Both forms of naturalism tend to turn man into the mere product andplaything of physical forces--climate, heredity, and the like, overwhich his will has no control.
Since literature and history have nomeaning from the point of view of moral choice they may at least bemade to yield the maximum of æsthetic satisfaction.
Oscar Wilde arguesin this wise for example in his dialogue “The Critic as Artist,” andconcludes that since man has no moral freedom or responsibility, andcannot therefore be guided in his conduct by the past experience of therace, he may at least turn this experience into an incomparable “bowerof dreams.
The pain of Leopardi crying out against life becomesour pain.
Theocritus blows on his pipe and we laugh with the lips ofnymph and shepherd.
In the wolf-skin of Pierre Vidal we flee beforethe hounds, and in the armor of Lancelot we ride from the bower of thequeen.
We have whispered the secret of our love beneath the cowl ofAbelard, and in the stained raiment of Villon have put our shame intosong,” etc.
The assumption that runs through this passage that the mere æstheticcontemplation of past experience gives the equivalent of actualexperience is found in writers of far higher standing than Wilde--inRenan, for instance.
The æsthete would look on his dream as asubstitute for the actual, and at the same time convert the actualinto a dream.
Die Welt wird Traum, der Traum wird Welt.
It isnot easy to take such a programme of universal dreaming seriously.
In the long run the dreamer himself does not find it easy to take itseriously.
For his attempts to live his chimera result, as we haveseen in the case of romantic love, in more or less disastrous defeatand disillusion.
The disillusioned romanticist continues to cling tohis dream, but intellectually, at least, he often comes at the sametime to stand aloof from it.
This subject of disillusion may best beconsidered, along with certain other important aspects of the movement,in connection with the singular phenomenon known as romantic irony.
CHAPTER VIIROMANTIC IRONYThe first romanticist who worked out a theory of irony was FriedrichSchlegel.
170 The attempt to put this theory into practice, afterthe fashion of Tieck’s plays, seemed and seemed rightly even to laterrepresentatives of the movement to be extravagant.
Thus Hegel, whoin his ideas on art continues in so many respects the Schlegels,repudiates irony.
Formerly, says Heine, who is himself in any largersurvey, the chief of German romantic ironists, when a man had said astupid thing he had said it; now he can explain it away as “irony.
Nevertheless one cannot afford to neglect this early German theory.
It derives in an interesting way from the views that the partisansof original genius had put forth regarding the rôle of the creativeimagination.
The imagination as we have seen is to be free to wanderwild in its own empire of chimeras.
Rousseau showed the possibilitiesof an imagination that is at once extraordinarily rich and alsoperfectly free in this sense.
I have said that Kant believed like theoriginal genius that the nobility of art depends on the free “play”of the imagination; though he adds that art should at the same timesubmit to a purpose that is not a purpose--whatever that may mean.
Schiller in his “Æsthetic Letters” relaxed the rationalistic rigor ofKant in favor of feeling and associated even more emphatically theideality and creativeness of art with its free imaginative play,its emancipation from specific aim.
The personal friction that arosebetween the Schlegels and Schiller has perhaps obscured somewhat theirgeneral indebtedness to him.
The Schlegelian irony in particular merelypushes to an extreme the doctrine that nothing must interfere withthe imagination in its creative play.
The caprice of the poet,” asFriedrich Schlegel says, “suffers no law above itself.
Why indeedshould the poet allow any restriction to be placed upon his caprice ina universe that is after all only a projection of himself? The playtheory of art is here supplemented by the philosophy of Fichte.
171In justice to him it should be said that though his philosophy maynot rise above the level of temperament, he at least had a severe andstoical temperament, and if only for this reason his “transcendentalego” is far less obviously ego than that which appears in the ironyof his romantic followers.
When a man has taken possession of histranscendental ego, according to the Schlegels and Novalis, he looksdown on his ordinary ego and stands aloof from it.
His ordinary ego mayachieve poetry but his transcendental ego must achieve the poetry ofpoetry.
But there is in him something that may stand aloof even fromthis aloofness and so on indefinitely.
Romantic irony joins here withwhat is perhaps the chief preoccupation of the German romanticists, theidea of the infinite or, as they term it, the striving for endlessness(Unendlichkeitstreben).
Now, according to the romanticist, a mancan show that he lays hold imaginatively upon the infinite only byexpanding beyond what his age holds to be normal and central--itsconventions in short; nay more, he must expand away from any centre hehas himself achieved.
For to hold fast to a centre of any kind impliesthe acceptance of limitations and to accept limitations is to befinite, and to be finite is, as Blake says, to become mechanical; andthe whole of romanticism is a protest against the mechanizing of life.
No man therefore deserves to rank as a transcendental egotist unlesshe has learned to mock not merely at the convictions of others but athis own, unless he has become capable of self-parody.
Objection,” saysNietzsche, “evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs ofhealth; everything absolute belongs to pathology.
172One cannot repeat too often that what the romanticist always sees atthe centre is either the mere rationalist or else the philistine; andhe therefore inclines to measure his own distinction by his remotenessfrom any possible centre.
Now thus to be always moving away fromcentrality is to be paradoxical, and romantic irony is, as FriedrichSchlegel says, identical with paradox.
Irony, paradox and the idea ofthe infinite have as a matter of fact so many points of contact inromanticism that they may profitably be treated together.
Friedrich Schlegel sought illustrious sponsors in the past for histheory of irony.
Among others he invoked the Greeks and put himself inparticular under the patronage of Socrates.
But Greek irony always hada centre.
The ironical contrast is between this centre and somethingthat is less central.
Take for example the so-called irony of Greektragedy.
The tragic character speaks and acts in darkness as tohis impending doom, regarding which the spectator is comparativelyenlightened.
To take another example, the German romanticistswere especially absurd in their attempts to set up Tieck as a newAristophanes.
For Aristophanes, however wild and irresponsible he mayseem in the play of his imagination, never quite loses sight of hiscentre, a centre from which the comic spirit proceeds and to which itreturns.
Above all, however far he may push his mockery, he never mocksat his own convictions; he never, like Tieck, indulges in self-parody.
A glance at the parabasis of almost any one of his plays will sufficeto show that he was willing to lay himself open to the charge ofbeing unduly didactic rather than to the charge of being aimless.
Theuniverse of Tieck, on the other hand, is a truly romantic universe: ithas no centre, or what amounts to the same thing, it has at its centrethat symbol of spiritual stagnation, the philistine, and his inabilityto rise above a dull didacticism.
The romanticist cherishes theillusion that to be a spiritual vagrant is to be exalted on a pinnacleabove the plain citizen.
According to Professor Stuart P.
Sherman, theIrish dramatist Synge indulges in gypsy laughter from the bushes,173a good description of romantic irony in general.
The irony of Socrates, to take the most important example of Greekirony, is not of the centrifugal character.
Socrates professesignorance, and this profession seems very ironical, for it turns outthat his ignorance is more enlightened, that is, more central thanother men’s swelling conceit of knowledge.
It does not follow thatSocrates is insincere in his profession of ignorance; for though hisknowledge may be as light in comparison with that of the ordinaryAthenian, he sees that in comparison with true and perfect knowledge itis only darkness.
For Socrates was no mere rationalist; he was a man ofinsight, one would even be tempted to say a mystic were it not for thecorruption of the term mystic by the romanticists.
This being the casehe saw that man is by his very nature precluded from true and perfectknowledge.
A path, however, opens up before him towards this knowledge,and this path he should seek to follow even though it is in a senseendless, even though beyond any centre he can attain within the boundsof his finite experience there is destined always to be something stillmore central.
Towards the mere dogmatist, the man who thinks he hasachieved some fixed and final centre, the attitude of Socrates is thatof scepticism.
This attitude implies a certain degree of detachmentfrom the received beliefs and conventions of his time, and it isall the more important to distinguish here between Socrates and theromanticists because of the superficial likeness; and also becausethere is between the Rousseauists and some of the Greeks who livedabout the time of Socrates a real likeness.
Promethean individualismwas already rife at that time, and on the negative side it resultedthen as since in a break with tradition, and on the positive side in anoscillation between the cult of force and the exaltation of sympathy,between admiration for the strong man and compassion for the weak.
Itis hardly possible to overlook these Promethean elements in the playsof Euripides.
Antisthenes and the cynics, again, who professed toderive from Socrates, established an opposition between “nature” andconvention even more radical in some respects than that establishedby Rousseau.
Moreover Socrates himself was perhaps needlesslyunconventional and also unduly inclined to paradox--as when hesuggested to the jury who tried him that as an appropriate punishmenthe should be supported at the public expense in the prytaneum.
Yet inhis inner spirit and in spite of certain minor eccentricities, Socrateswas neither a superman nor a Bohemian, but a humanist.
Now that thecritical spirit was abroad and the traditional basis for conduct wasfailing, he was chiefly concerned with putting conduct on a positiveand critical basis.
In establishing this basis his constant appeal isto actual experience and the more homely this experience the more itseems to please him.
While working out the new basis for conduct hecontinues to observe the existing laws and customs; or if he gets awayfrom the traditional discipline it is towards a stricter discipline;if he repudiates in aught the common sense of his day, it is infavor of a commoner sense.
One may say indeed that Socrates and theRousseauists (who are in this respect like some of the sophists) areboth moving away from convention but in opposite directions.
What theromanticist opposes to convention is his “genius,” that is his uniqueand private self.
What Socrates opposes to convention is his universaland ethical self.
According to Friedrich Schlegel, a man can never be aphilosopher but only become one; if at any time he thinks that he is aphilosopher he ceases to become one.
The romanticist is right in thusthinking that to remain fixed at any particular point is to stagnate.
Man is, as Nietzsche says, the being who must always surpass himself,but he has--and this is a point that Nietzsche did not sufficientlyconsider--a choice of direction in his everlasting pilgrimage.
Theman who is moving away from some particular centre will always seemparadoxical to the man who remains at it, but he may be moving awayfrom it in either the romantic or the ethical direction.
In the firstcase he is moving from a more normal to a less normal experience,in the second case he is moving towards an experience that is moreprofoundly representative.
The New Testament abounds in examples of theethical paradox--what one may term the paradox of humility.
A man mustlose his life to find it, etc.
It is possible, however, to push eventhis type of paradox too far, to push it to a point where it affrontsnot merely some particular convention but the good sense of mankinditself, and this is a far graver matter.
Pascal falls into this excesswhen he says that sickness is the natural state of the Christian.
As aresult of its supreme emphasis on humility Christianity from the startinclined unduly perhaps towards this type of paradox.
It is hardlyworth while, as Goethe said, to live seventy years in this world if allthat one learn here below is only folly in the sight of God.
One of the most delicate of tasks is to determine whether a paradoxoccupies a position more or less central than the convention to whichit is opposed.
A somewhat similar problem is to determine which oftwo differing conventions has the greater degree of centrality.
Forone convention may as compared with another seem highly paradoxical.
In 1870, it was announced at Peking that his Majesty the Emperor hadhad the good fortune to catch the small-pox.
The auspiciousness ofsmall-pox was part of the Chinese convention at this time, but tothose of us who live under another convention it is a blessing we wouldwillingly forego.
But much in the Chinese convention, so far from beingabsurd, reflects the Confucian good sense, and if the Chinese decide tobreak with their convention, they should evidently consider long andcarefully in which direction they are going to move--whether towardssomething more central, or something more eccentric.
As to the direction in which Rousseau is moving and therefore asto the quality of his paradoxes there can be little question.
Hisparadoxes--and he is perhaps the most paradoxical of writers--reducethemselves on analysis to the notion that man has suffered a loss ofgoodness by being civilized, by having had imposed on his unconsciousand instinctive self some humanistic or religious discipline--e.
g.
The man who reflects is a depraved animal”; “True Christians are meantto be slaves”; decorum is only the “varnish of vice” or the “mask ofhypocrisy.
Innumerable paradoxes of this kind will immediately occurto one as characteristic of Rousseau and his followers.
These paradoxesmay be termed in opposition to those of humility, the paradoxes ofspontaneity.
The man who holds them is plainly moving in an oppositedirection not merely from the Christian but from the Socraticindividualist.
He is moving from the more representative to the lessrepresentative and not towards some deeper centre of experience,as would be the case if he were tending towards either humanism orreligion.
Wordsworth has been widely accepted not merely as a poet butas a religious teacher, and it is therefore important to note that hisparadoxes are prevailingly of the Rousseauistic type.
His verse isnever more spontaneous or, as he would say, inevitable, than when itis celebrating the gospel of spontaneity.
I have already pointed outsome of the paradoxes that he opposes to pseudo-classic decorum: e.
g.
his attempt to bestow poetical dignity and importance upon the ass,and to make of it a model of moral excellence, also to find poetry inan idiot boy and to associate sublimity with a pedlar in defiance ofthe ordinary character of pedlars.
In general Wordsworth indulges inRousseauistic paradoxes when he urges us to look to peasants for thetrue language of poetry and would have us believe that man is taughtby “woods and rills” and not by contact with his fellow men.
He pushesthis latter paradox to a point that would have made even Rousseau“stare and gasp” when he asserts that    One impulse from a vernal wood    May teach you more of man    Of moral evil and of good    Than all the sages can.
Another form of this same paradox that what comes from naturespontaneously is better than what can be acquired by conscious effortis found in his poem “Lucy Gray”:    No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;    She dwelt on a wide moor,    The sweetest thing that ever grew    Beside a human door!True maidenhood is made up of a thousand decorums; but thisRousseauistic maiden would have seemed too artificial if she had beenreared in a house instead of “growing” out of doors; she might inthat case have been a human being and not a “thing” and this wouldplainly have detracted from her spontaneity.
Wordsworth’s paradoxesabout children have a similar origin.
A child who at the age of sixis a “mighty prophet, seer blest,” is a highly improbable not to sayimpossible child.
The “Nature” again of “Heart-Leap Well” which bothfeels and inspires pity is more remote from normal experience than theNature “red in tooth and claw” of Tennyson.
Wordsworth indeed wouldseem to have a penchant for paradox even when he is less obviouslyinspired by his naturalistic thesis.
A study of Wordsworth’s life shows that he became progressivelydisillusioned regarding Rousseauistic spontaneity.
He became lessparadoxical as he grew older and in almost the same measure, one istempted to say, less poetical.
He returns gradually to the traditionalforms until radicals come to look upon him as the “lost leader.
Hefinds it hard, however, to wean his imagination from its primitivisticArcadias; so that what one finds, in writing like the “EcclesiasticalSonnets,” is not imaginative fire but at best a sober intellectualconviction, an opposition between the head and the heart in short thatsuggests somewhat Chateaubriand and the “Genius of Christianity.
174If Wordsworth had lost faith in his revolutionary and naturalisticideal, and had at the same time refused to return to the traditionalforms, one might then have seen in his work something of the homelesshovering of the romantic ironist.
If, on the other hand, he hadworked away from the centre that the traditional forms give to lifetowards a more positive and critical centre, if, in other words,he had broken with the past not on Rousseauistic, but on Socraticlines, he would have needed an imagination of different quality, animagination less idyllic and pastoral and more ethical than that heusually displays.
175 For the ethical imagination alone can guide onenot indeed to any fixed centre but to an ever increasing centrality.
We are here confronted once more with the question of the infinitewhich comes very close to the ultimate ground of difference betweenclassicist and romanticist.
The centre that one perceives with theaid of the classical imagination and that sets bounds to impulse anddesire may, as I have already said, be defined in opposition to theouter infinite of expansion as the inner or human infinite.
If wemoderns, to repeat Nietzsche, are unable to attain proportionatenessit is because “our itching is really the itching for the infinite,the immeasurable.
Thus to associate the infinite only with theimmeasurable, to fail to perceive that the element of form and the curbit puts on the imagination are not external and artificial, but comefrom the very depths, is to betray the fact that one is a barbarian.
Nietzsche and many other romanticists are capable on occasion ofadmiring the proportionateness that comes from allegiance to somecentre.
But after all the human spirit must be ever advancing, andits only motive powers, according to romantic logic, are wonder andcuriosity; and so from the perfectly sound premise that man is thebeing who must always surpass himself, Nietzsche draws the perfectlyunsound conclusion that the only way for man thus constantly to surpasshimself and so show his infinitude is to spurn all limits and “livedangerously.
The Greeks themselves, according to Renan, will someday seem the “apostles of ennui,” for the very perfection of theirform shows a lack of aspiration.
To submit to form is to be static,whereas “romantic poetry,” says Friedrich Schlegel magnificently, is“universal progressive poetry.
Now the only effective counterpoise tothe endless expansiveness that is implied in such a programme is theinner or human infinite of concentration.
For it is perfectly true thatthere is something in man that is not satisfied with the finite andthat, if he becomes stationary, he is at once haunted by the spectreof ennui.
Man may indeed be defined as the insatiable animal; and themore imaginative he is the more insatiable he is likely to become, forit is the imagination that gives him access to the infinite in everysense of the word.
In a way Baudelaire is right when he describesennui as a “delicate monster” that selects as his prey the most highlygifted natures.
Marguerite d’Angoulême already speaks of the “ennuiproper to well-born spirits.
Now religion seeks no less than romancean escape from ennui.
Bossuet is at one with Baudelaire when hedilates on that “inexorable ennui which is the very substance of humanlife.
But Bossuet and Baudelaire differ utterly in the remedies theypropose for ennui.
Baudelaire hopes to escape from ennui by dreamingof the superlative emotional adventure, by indulging in infinite,indeterminate desire, and becomes more and more restless in his questfor a something that at the end always eludes him.
This infinite ofnostalgia has nothing in common with the infinite of religion.
Nodistinction is more important than that between the man who feels thedivine discontent of religion, and the man who is suffering frommere romantic restlessness.
According to religion man must seek thesatisfaction that the finite fails to give by looking not without butwithin; and to look within he must in the literal sense of the wordundergo conversion.
A path will then be found to open up before him, apath of which he cannot see the end.
He merely knows that to advanceon this path is to increase in peace, poise, centrality; though beyondany calm he can attain is always a deeper centre of calm.
The goalis at an infinite remove.
This is the truth that St.
Augustine putstheologically when he exclaims: “For thou hast made us for thyselfand our heart is restless until it findeth peace in thee.
176 Oneshould insist that this question of the two infinites is not abstractand metaphysical but bears on what is most concrete and immediatein experience.
If the inner and human infinite cannot be formulatedintellectually, it can be known practically in its effect on life andconduct.
Goethe says of Werther that he “treated his heart like a sickchild; its every wish was granted it.
My restless heart asked mefor something else,” says Rousseau.
René,” says Chateaubriand, “wasenchanted, tormented and, as it were, possessed by the demon of hisheart.
Mr. Galsworthy speaks in a similar vein of “the aching for thewild, the passionate, the new, that never quite dies in a man’s heart.
But is there not deep down in the human breast another heart that isfelt as a power of control over this romantic heart and can keep withindue bounds “its aching for the wild, the passionate, the new.
This isthe heart, it would seem, to which a man must hearken if he is not fora “little honey of romance” to abandon his “ancient wisdom and austerecontrol.
The romantic corruption of the infinite here joins with the romanticcorruption of conscience, the transformation of conscience from aninner check into an expansive emotion that I have already traced inShaftesbury and Rousseau.
But one should add that in some of itsaspects this corruption of the idea of the infinite antedates thewhole modern movement.
At least the beginnings of it can be found inancient Greece,--especially in that “delirious and diseased Greece”of which Joubert speaks--the Greece of the neo-Platonists.
There isalready in the neo-Platonic notion of the infinite a strong elementof expansiveness.
Aristotle and the older Greeks conceived of theinfinite in this sense as bad.
That something in human nature whichis always reaching out for more--whether the more of sensation or ofpower or of knowledge--was, they held, to be strictly reined in anddisciplined to the law of measure.
All the furies lie in wait for theman who overextends himself.
He is ripening for Nemesis.
Nothing toomuch.
Think as a mortal.
The half is better than the whole.
In hisattitude towards man’s expansive self the Greek as a rule stands formediation, and not like the more austere Christian, for renunciation.
Yet Plato frequently and Aristotle at times mount from the humanisticto the religious level.
One of the most impressive passages inphilosophy is that in which Aristotle, perhaps the chief exponent ofthe law of measure, affirms that one who has really faced about andis moving towards the inner infinite needs no warning against excess:“We should not give heed,” he says, “to those who bid one think asa mortal, but so far as we can we should make ourselves immortal anddo all with a view to a life in accord with the best Principle inus.
177 (This Principle Aristotle goes on to say is a man’s trueself.
The earlier Greek distinction between an outer and evil infiniteof expansive desire and an inner infinite that is raised above theflux and yet rules it, is, in the Aristotelian phrase, its “unmovedmover,” became blurred, as I have said, during the Alexandrian period.
The Alexandrian influence entered to some extent into Christianityitself and filtered through various channels down to modern times.
Some of the romanticists went directly to the neo-Platonists,especially Plotinus.
Still more were affected by Jacob Boehme, whohimself had no direct knowledge of the Alexandrian theosophy.
Thistheosophy appears nevertheless in combination with other elements inhis writings.
He appealed to the new school by his insistence on theelement of appetency or desire, by his universal symbolizing, aboveall by his tendency to make of the divine an affirmative instead of arestrictive force--a something that pushes forward instead of holdingback.
The expansive elements are moderated in Boehme himself and indisciples like Law by genuinely religious elements--e.
g.
humilityand the idea of conversion.
What happens when the expansiveness isdivorced from these elements, one may see in another English followerof Boehme--William Blake.
To be both beautiful and wise one needs,according to Blake, only to be exuberant.
The influence of Boehmeblends in Blake with the new æstheticism.
Jesus himself, he says, sofar from being restrained “was all virtue, and acted from impulse notfrom rules.
This purely æsthetic and impulsive Jesus has been cruellymaligned, as we learn from the poem entitled the “Everlasting Gospel,”by being represented as humble and chaste.
Religion itself thus becomesin Blake the mere sport of a powerful and uncontrolled imagination,and this we are told is mysticism.
I have already contrasted withthis type of mysticism something that goes under the same name andis yet utterly different--the mysticism of ancient India.
Insteadof conceiving of the divine in terms of expansion the Oriental sagedefines it experimentally as the “inner check.
No more fundamentaldistinction perhaps can be made than that between those who associatethe good with the yes-principle and those who associate it rather withthe no-principle.
But I need not repeat what I have said elsewhere onthe romantic attempt to discredit the veto power.
Let no one thinkthat this contrast is merely metaphysical.
The whole problem of evilis involved in it and all the innumerable practical consequences thatfollow from one’s attitude towards this problem.
The passage in whichFaust defines the devil as the “spirit that always says no” would seemto derive directly or indirectly from Boehme.
According to Boehmegood can be known only through evil.
God therefore divides his willinto two, the “yes” and the “no,” and so founds an eternal contrastto himself in order to enter into a struggle with it, and finally todiscipline and assimilate it.
The object of all manifested natureis the transforming of the will which says “no” into the will whichsays “yes.
178 The opposition between good and evil tends to loseits reality when it thus becomes a sort of sham battle that God getsup with himself (without contraries is no progression, says Blake),or when, to take the form that the doctrine assumes in “Faust,” thedevil appears as the necessary though unwilling instrument of man’sbetterment.
The recoil from the doctrine of total depravity was perhapsinevitable.
What is sinister is that advantage has been taken of thisrecoil to tamper with the problem of evil itself.
Partial evil we aretold is universal good; or else evil is only good in the making.
Fora Rousseau or a Shelley it is something mysteriously imposed fromwithout on a spotless human nature; for a Wordsworth it is somethingone may escape by contemplating the speargrass on the wall.
179 For aNovalis sin is a mere illusion of which a man should rid his mind if heaspires to become a “magic idealist.
180 In spite of his quaint Toryprejudices Dr.
Johnson is one of the few persons in recent times thatone may term wise without serious qualification because he never dodgesor equivocates in dealing with the problem of evil; he never fades awayfrom the fact of evil into some theosophic or sentimental dream.
The rise of a purely expansive view of life in the eighteenth centurywas marked by a great revival of enthusiasm.
The chief grievance ofthe expansionist indeed against the no-principle is that it killsenthusiasm.
But concentration no less than expansion may have its owntype of enthusiasm.
It is therefore imperative in an age that hasrepudiated the traditional sanctions and set out to walk by the innerlight that all general terms and in particular the term enthusiasmshould be protected by a powerful dialectic.
Nothing is more perilousthan an uncritical enthusiasm, since it is only by criticism that onemay determine whether the enthusiast is a man who is moving towardswisdom or is a candidate for Bedlam.
The Rousseauist, however, exaltsenthusiasm at the same time that he depreciates discrimination.
Enthusiasm,” says Emerson, “is the height of man.
It is the passagefrom the human to the divine.
It is only too characteristic of Emersonand of the whole school to which he belongs, to put forth statements ofthis kind without any dialectical protection.
The type of enthusiasmto which Emerson’s praise might be properly applied, the type thathas been defined as exalted peace, though extremely rare, actuallyexists.
A commoner type of enthusiasm during the past century is thatwhich has been defined as “the rapturous disintegration of civilizedhuman nature.
When we have got our fingers well burned as a result ofour failure to make the necessary discriminations, we may fly to theopposite extreme like the men of the early eighteenth century amongwhom, as is well known, enthusiasm had become a term of vituperation.
This dislike of enthusiasm was the natural recoil from the uncriticalfollowing of the inner light by the fanatics of the seventeenthcentury.
Shaftesbury attacks this older type of enthusiasm and at thesame time prepares the way for the new emotional enthusiasm.
One cannotsay, however, that any such sharp separation of types appears in therevival of enthusiasm that begins about the middle of the eighteenthcentury, though some of those who were working for this revival feltthe need of discriminating:    That which concerns us therefore is to see    What Species of Enthusiasts we be--says John Byrom in his poem on Enthusiasm.
The different species,however,--the enthusiasm of the Evangelicals and Wesleyans, theenthusiasm of those who like Law and his disciple Byrom hearken backto Boehme, the enthusiasm of Rousseau and the sentimentalists, tend torun together.
To “let one’s feelings run in soft luxurious flow,”181is, as Newman says, at the opposite pole from spirituality.
Yet much ofthis mere emotional facility appears alongside of genuinely religiouselements in the enthusiasm of the Methodist.
One may get a notion ofthe jumble to which I refer by reading a book like Henry Brooke’s“Fool of Quality.
Brooke is at one and the same time a disciple ofBoehme and Rousseau while being more or less affiliated with theMethodistic movement.
The book indeed was revised and abridged byJohn Wesley himself and in this form had a wide circulation among hisfollowers.
182The enthusiasm that has marked the modern movement has plainly not beensufficiently critical.
Perhaps the first discovery that any one willmake who wishes to be at once critical and enthusiastic is that in agenuinely spiritual enthusiasm the inner light and the inner checkare practically identical.
He will find that if he is to rise abovethe naturalistic level he must curb constantly his expansive desireswith reference to some centre that is set above the flux.
Here let merepeat is the supreme rôle of the imagination.
The man who has ceasedto lean on outer standards can perceive his new standards or centre ofcontrol only through its aid.
I have tried to show that to aim at sucha centre is not to be stagnant and stationary but on the contrary tobe at once purposeful and progressive.
To assert that the creativenessof the imagination is incompatible with centrality or, what amounts tothe same thing, with purpose, is to assert that the creativeness ofthe imagination is incompatible with reality or at least such realityas man may attain.
Life is at best a series of illusions; the wholeoffice of philosophy is to keep it from degenerating into a seriesof delusions.
If we are to keep it from thus degenerating we need tograsp above all the difference between the eccentric and the concentricimagination.
To look for serious guidance to an imagination that owesallegiance to nothing above itself, is to run the risk of taking somecloud bank for terra firma.
The eccentric imagination may give accessto the “infinite,” but it is an infinite empty of content and thereforean infinite not of peace but of restlessness.
Can any one maintainseriously that there is aught in common between the “striving forendlessness” of the German romanticists and the supreme and perfectCentre that Dante glimpses at the end of the “Divine Comedy” and in thepresence of which he becomes dumb?We are told to follow the gleam, but the counsel is somewhat ambiguous.
The gleam that one follows may be that which is associated with theconcentric imagination and which gives steadiness and informingpurpose, or it may be the romantic will o’ the wisp.
One may, as Ihave said, in recreative moments allow one’s imagination to wanderwithout control, but to take these wanderings seriously is to engagein a sort of endless pilgrimage in the void.
The romanticist isconstantly yielding to the “spell” of this or the “lure” of that, orthe “call” of some other thing.
But when the wonder and strangenessthat he is chasing are overtaken, they at once cease to be wondrousand strange, while the gleam is already dancing over some other objecton the distant horizon.
For nothing is in itself romantic, it is onlyimagining that makes it so.
Romanticism is the pursuit of the elementof illusion in things for its own sake; it is in short the cherishingof glamour.
The word glamour introduced into literary usage frompopular Scotch usage by Walter Scott itself illustrates this tendency.
Traced etymologically, it turns out to be the same word as grammar.
Inan illiterate age to know how to write at all was a weird and magicalaccomplishment,183 but in an educated age, nothing is so drearilyunromantic, so lacking in glamour as grammar.
The final question that arises in connection with this subject iswhether one may quell the mere restlessness of one’s spirit and imposeupon it an ethical purpose.
The man who has no definite end is lost,”says Montaigne.
The upshot of the romantic supposition that purpose isincompatible with the freedom of the imagination is a philosophy likethat of Nietzsche.
He can conceive of nothing beyond whirling foreveron the wheel of change (“the eternal recurrence”) without any goal orfirm refuge that is set above the flux.
He could not help doubtingat times whether happiness was to be found after all in mere endless,purposeless mutation.
Have I still a goal? A haven towards which my sail is set?    A good wind? Ah, he only who knoweth whither he saileth,    knoweth what wind is good, and a fair wind for him.
What still remaineth to me? A heart weary and flippant; an    unstable will; fluttering wings; a broken backbone.
Where is my home? For it do I ask and seek, and have    sought, but have not found it.
O eternal everywhere, O eternal    nowhere, O eternal--in vain.
184To allow one’s self to revolve passively on the wheel of change(samsāra) seemed to the Oriental sage the acme of evil.
An old Hinduwriter compares the man who does not impose a firm purpose upon themanifold solicitations of sense to a charioteer who fails to reinin his restless steeds185--a comparison suggested independentlyto Ricarda Huch by the lives of the German romanticists.
In theabsence of central control, the parts of the self tend to pull eachin a different way.
It is not surprising that in so centrifugal amovement, at least on the human and spiritual level, one should findso many instances of disintegrated and multiple personality.
Thefascination that the phenomenon of the double (Doppelgängerei) hadfor Hoffmann and other German romanticists is well known.
186 It maywell be that some such disintegration of the self takes place underextreme emotional stress.
187 We should not fail to note here theusual coöperation between the emotional and the scientific naturalist.
Like the romanticist, the scientific psychologist is more interestedin the abnormal than in the normal.
According to the Freudians, thepersonality that has become incapable of any conscious aim is not leftentirely rudderless.
The guidance that it is unable to give itself issupplied to it by some “wish,” usually obscene, from the sub-consciousrealm of dreams.
The Freudian then proceeds to develop what may be trueof the hysterical degenerate into a complete view of life.
Man is in danger of being deprived of every last scrap and vestige ofhis humanity by this working together of romanticism and science.
Forman becomes human only in so far as he exercises moral choice.
He mustalso enter upon the pathway of ethical purpose if he is to achievehappiness.
Moods,” says Novalis, “undefined emotions, not definedemotions and feelings, give happiness.
The experience of life showsso plainly that this is not so that the romanticist is tempted toseek shelter once more from his mere vagrancy of spirit in the outerdiscipline he has abandoned.
To such unsettled ones as thou, seemethat last even a prisoner blessed.
Didst thou ever see how capturedcriminals sleep? They sleep quietly, they enjoy their new security.
Beware in the end lest a narrow faith capture thee, a hard rigorousdelusion! For now everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth andtempteth thee.
188Various reasons have been given for romantic conversions toCatholicism--for example, the desire for confession (though theCatholic does not, like the Rousseauist, confess himself from thehousetops), the æsthetic appeal of Catholic rites and ceremonies, etc.
The sentence of Nietzsche puts us on the track of still another reason.
The affinity of certain romantic converts for the Church is that of thejelly-fish for the rock.
It is appropriate that Friedrich Schlegel,the great apostle of irony, should after a career as a heaven-stormingTitan end by submitting to this most rigid of all forms of outerauthority.
For it should now be possible to return after our digression on paradoxand the idea of the infinite and the perils of aimlessness, to romanticirony with a truer understanding of its significance.
Like so muchelse in this movement it is an attempt to give to a grave psychicweakness the prestige of strength--unless indeed one conceives thesuperior personality to be the one that lacks a centre and principle ofcontrol.
Man it has usually been held should think lightly of himselfbut should have some conviction for which he is ready to die.
Theromantic ironist, on the other hand, is often morbidly sensitive abouthimself, but is ready to mock at his own convictions.
Rousseau was noromantic ironist, but the root of self-parody is found neverthelessin his saying that his heart and his head did not seem to belong tothe same individual.
Everything of course is a matter of degree.
Whatpoor mortal can say that he is perfectly at one with himself? FriedrichSchlegel is not entirely wrong when he discovers elements of ironybased on an opposition between the head and the heart in writers likeAriosto and Cervantes, who love the very mediæval tales that they aretreating in a spirit of mockery.
Yet the laughter of Cervantes is notgypsy laughter.
He is one of those who next to Shakespeare deserve thepraise of having dwelt close to the centre of human nature and so canin only a minor degree be ranked with the romantic ironists.
In the extreme type of romantic ironist not only are intellect andemotion at loggerheads but action often belies both: he thinks onething and feels another and does still a third.
The most ironicalcontrast of all is that between the romantic “ideal” and the actualevent.
The whole of romantic morality is from this point of view, asI have tried to show, a monstrous series of ironies.
The pacifist,for example, has been disillusioned so often that he should by thistime be able to qualify as a romantic ironist, to look, that is, witha certain aloofness on his own dream.
The crumbling of the ideal isoften so complete indeed when put to the test that irony is at times,we may suppose, a merciful alternative to madness.
When disillusionovertakes the uncritical enthusiast, when he finds that he has takensome cloud bank for terra firma, he continues to cling to his dream,but at the same time wishes to show that he is no longer the dupe ofit; and so “hot baths of sentiment,” as Jean Paul says of his novels,“are followed by cold douches of irony.
The true German master ofthe genre is, however, Heine.
Every one knows with what coldness hishead came to survey the enthusiasms of his heart, whether in love orpolitics.
One may again measure the havoc that life had wrought withRenan’s ideals if one compares the tone of his youthful “Future ofScience” with the irony of his later writings.
He compliments Jesus byascribing to him an ironical detachment similar to his own.
Jesus, hesays, has that mark of the superior nature--the power to rise abovehis own dream and to smile down upon it.
Anatole France, who is evenmore completely detached from his own dreams than his master Renan,sums up the romantic emancipation of imagination and sensibility fromany definite centre when he says that life should have as its supremewitnesses irony and pity.
Irony is on the negative side, it should be remembered, a way ofaffirming one’s escape from traditional and conventional control, ofshowing the supremacy of mood over decorum.
There are poems old andnew which throughout breathe the divine breath of irony.
Within livesthe poet’s mood that surveys all, rising infinitely above everythingfinite, even above his own art, virtue or genius.
189 Decorum is forthe classicist the grand masterpiece to observe because it is onlythus he can show that he has a genuine centre set above his own ego;it is only by the allegiance of his imagination to this centre thathe can give the illusion of a higher reality.
The romantic ironistshatters the illusion wantonly.
It is as though he would inflict uponthe reader the disillusion from which he has himself suffered.
By hisswift passage from one mood to another (Stimmungsbrechung) he showsthat he is subject to no centre.
The effect is often that of a suddenbreaking of the spell of poetry by an intrusion of the poet’s ego.
Someof the best examples are found in that masterpiece of romantic irony,“Don Juan.
190Closely allied to the irony of emotional disillusion is a certain typeof misanthropy.
You form an ideal of man that is only an Arcadian dreamand then shrink back from man when you find that he does not correspondto your ideal.
I have said that the romantic lover does not love areal person but only a projection of his mood.
This substitution ofillusion for reality often appears in the relations of the romanticistwith other persons.
Shelley, for example, begins by seeing in ElizabethHitchener an angel of light and then discovers that she is instead a“brown demon.
He did not at any time see the real Elizabeth Hitchener.
She merely reflects back to him two of his own moods.
The tendermisanthropy of the Rousseauist is at the opposite pole from that of aSwift, which is the misanthropy of naked intellect.
Instead of seeinghuman nature through an Arcadian haze he saw it without any illusion atall.
His irony is like that of Socrates, the irony of intellect.
Itsbitterness and cruelty arise from the fact that his intellect does not,like the intellect of Socrates, have the support of insight.
Pascalwould have said that Swift saw man’s misery without at the same timeseeing his grandeur.
For man’s grandeur is due to his infinitude andthis infinitude cannot be perceived directly, but only through a veilof illusion; only, that is, through a right use of the imagination.
Literary distinctions of this kind must of course be used cautiously.
Byron’s irony is prevailingly sentimental, but along with this romanticelement he has much irony and satire that Swift would have understoodperfectly.
The misanthropist of the Rousseauistic or Byronic type has a resourcethat was denied to Swift.
Having failed to find companionship among menhe can flee to nature.
Rousseau relates how when he had taken refuge onSt.
Peter’s Island he “exclaimed at times with deep emotion: Oh nature,oh my mother, here I am under your protection alone.
Here is no adroitand rascally man to interpose between you and me.
191 Few aspects ofromanticism are more important than this attempt to find companionshipand consolation in nature.
CHAPTER VIIIROMANTICISM AND NATUREOne of the most disquieting features of the modern movement isthe vagueness and ambiguity of its use of the word nature and theinnumerable sophistries that have resulted.
One can sympathize attimes with Sir Leslie Stephen’s wish that the word might be suppressedentirely.
This looseness of definition may be said to begin withthe very rise of naturalism in the Renaissance, and indeed to goback to the naturalists of Greek and Roman antiquity.
192 Evenwriters like Rabelais and Molière are not free from the suspicionof juggling dangerously on occasion with the different meanings ofthe word nature.
But the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries werenot merely naturalistic, they were also humanistic, and what theyusually meant by nature, as I have pointed out, was the conceptionof normal, representative human nature that they had worked out withthe aid of the ancients.
There is undeniably an element of narrownessand artificiality in this conception of nature, and a resultingunfriendliness, as appears in Pope’s definition of wit, towardsoriginality and invention.
In his “Art of Poetry” Boileau says, “Letnature be your sole study.
What he means by nature appears a few lineslater: “Study the court and become familiar with the town.
To thissomewhat conventionalized human nature the original genius opposed,as we have seen, the cult of primitive nature.
A whole revolution isimplied in Byron’s line:    I love not man the less, but nature more.
Any study of this topic must evidently turn on the question how far atdifferent times and by different schools of thought the realm of manand the realm of nature (as Byron uses the word) have been separatedand in what way, and also how far they have been run together and inwhat way.
For there may be different ways of running together manand nature.
Ruskin’s phrase the “pathetic fallacy” is unsatisfactorybecause it fails to recognize this fact.
The man who is guilty of thepathetic fallacy sees in nature emotions that are not really there butonly in himself.
Extreme examples of this confusion abound in Ruskin’sown writings.
Now the ancients also ran man and nature together, but inan entirely different way.
The Greek we are told never saw the oak treewithout at the same time seeing the dryad.
There is in this and similarassociations a sort of overflow of the human realm upon the forms ofouter nature whereas the Rousseauist instead of bestowing imaginativelyupon the oak tree a conscious life and an image akin to his own andso lifting it up to his level, would, if he could, become an oak treeand so enjoy its unconscious and vegetative felicity.
The Greek, onemay say, humanized nature; the Rousseauist naturalizes man.
Rousseau’sgreat discovery was revery; and revery is just this imaginative meltingof man into outer nature.
If the ancients failed to develop in a markeddegree this art of revery, it was not because they lacked naturalists.
Both Stoics and Epicureans, the two main varieties of naturalistswith which classical antiquity was familiar, inclined to affirm theultimate identity of the human and the natural order.
But both Stoicsand Epicureans would have found it hard to understand the indifferenceto the intellect and its activities that Rousseauistic revery implies.
The Stoics to be sure employed the intellect on an impossible anddisheartening task--that of founding on the natural order virtues thatthe natural order does not give.
The Epicureans remind one rather inmuch of their intellectual activity of the modern man of science.
Butthe Epicurean was less prone than the man of science to look on manas the mere passive creature of environment.
The views of the man ofscience about the springs of conduct often seem to coincide ratherclosely with those of Rousseau about “sensitive morality.
GeoffroySaint-Hilaire says that when reclining on the banks of the Nile he feltawakening within himself the instincts of the crocodile.
The point ofview is Rousseauistic perhaps rather than genuinely scientific.
AnEpicurus or a Lucretius would, we are probably safe in assuming, havebeen disquieted by any such surrender to the subrational, by any suchencroachment of the powers of the unconscious upon conscious control.
It is hard as a matter of fact to find in the ancients anythingresembling Rousseauistic revery, even when they yield to the pastoralmood.
Nature interests them as a rule less for its own sake than asa background for human action; and when they are concerned primarilywith nature, it is a nature that has been acted upon by man.
Theyhave a positive shrinking from wild and uncultivated nature.
Thegreen pastures and golden slopes of England,” says Lowell, “aresweeter both to the outward and to the inward eye that the hand of manhas immemorially cared for and caressed them.
This is an attitudetowards nature that an ancient would have understood perfectly.
Onemay indeed call it the Virgilian attitude from the ancient who hasperhaps expressed it most happily.
The man who lives in the grandmanner may indeed wish to impose on nature some of the fine proportionand symmetry of which he is conscious in himself and he may then fromour modern point of view carry the humanizing of nature too far.
Letus sing of woods,” says Virgil, “but let the woods be worthy of aconsul.
This line has sometimes been taken to be a prophecy of thePark of Versailles.
We may sympathize up to a certain point with thedesire to introduce a human symmetry into nature (such as appears, forinstance, in the Italian garden), but the peril is even greater herethan elsewhere of confounding the requirements of a real with those ofan artificial decorum.
I have already mentioned the neo-classicist whocomplained that the stars in heaven were not arranged in sufficientlysymmetrical patterns.
What has been said should make clear that though both humanist andRousseauist associate man with nature it is in very different ways,and that there is therefore an ambiguity in the expression “patheticfallacy.
It remains to show that men may not only associate themselveswith nature in different ways but that they may likewise differ intheir ways of asserting man’s separateness from nature.
The chiefdistinction to be made here is that between the humanist and thesupernaturalist.
Some sense of the gap between man and the “outworld”is almost inevitable and forces itself at times even upon those mostnaturalistically inclined:    Nor will I praise a cloud however bright,    Disparaging Man’s gifts and proper food--    Grove, isle, with every shape of sky-built dome,    Though clad in colors beautiful and pure,    Find in the heart of man no natural home.
193The Wordsworth who speaks here is scarcely the Wordsworth of TinternAbbey or the Wordsworth whose “daily teachers had been woods andrills.
He reminds us rather of Socrates who gave as his reason forgoing so rarely into the country, delightful as he found it when oncethere, that he did not learn from woods and rills but from the “menin the cities.
This sense of the separateness of the human and thenatural realm may be carried much further--to a point where an asceticdistrust of nature begins to appear.
Something of this ascetic distrustis seen for example in the following lines from Cardinal Newman:    There strayed awhile amid the woods of Dart    One who could love them, but who durst not love;    A vow had bound him ne’er to give his heart    To streamlet bright or soft secluded grove.
194The origins of this latter attitude towards nature are to be sought inmediæval Christianity rather than in classical antiquity.
No man whoknows the facts would assert for a moment that the man of the MiddleAges was incapable of looking on nature with other feelings thanthose of ascetic distrust.
It is none the less true that the man ofthe Middle Ages often saw in nature not merely something alien but apositive temptation and peril of the spirit.
In his attitude towardsnature as in other respects Petrarch is usually accounted the firstmodern.
He did what no man of the mediæval period is supposed to havedone before him, or indeed what scarcely any man of classical antiquitydid: he ascended a mountain out of sheer curiosity and simply to enjoythe prospect.
But those who tell of his ascent of Mt.
Ventoux sometimesforget to add that the passage of Saint Augustine195 that occurredto him at the top reflects the distrust of the more austere Christiantowards the whole natural order.
Petrarch is at once more ascetic andmore romantic in his attitude towards nature than the Greek or Roman.
Traces of Petrarch’s taste for solitary and even for wild nature areto be found throughout the Renaissance and the seventeenth century.
But the recoil from supernaturalism that took place at this time ledrather, as I have remarked, to a revival of the Græco-Roman humanismwith something more of artifice and convention, and to an even moremarked preference196 of the town to the country.
An age that aimsfirst of all at urbanity must necessarily be more urban than rural inits predilections.
It was a sort of condescension for the neo-classicalhumanist to turn from the central model he was imitating to mereunadorned nature, and even then he felt that he must be careful notto condescend too far.
Even when writing pastorals he was warned byScaliger to avoid details that are too redolent of the real country;he should indulge at most in an “urbane rusticity.
Wild nature theneo-classicist finds simply repellent.
Mountains he looks upon as“earth’s dishonor and encumbering load.
The Alps were regarded asthe place where Nature swept up the rubbish of the earth to clearthe plains of Lombardy.
At last,” says a German traveller of theseventeenth century, “we left the horrible and wearisome mountains andthe beautiful flat landscape was joyfully welcomed.
The taste formountain scenery is associated no doubt to some extent, as has beensuggested, with the increasing ease and comfort of travel that has comewith the progress of the utilitarian movement.
It is scarcely necessaryto point the contrast between the Switzerland of which Evelyn tells inhis diary197 and the Switzerland in which one may go by funicular tothe top of the Jungfrau.
Those who in the eighteenth century began to feel the need of lesstrimness in nature and human nature were not it is true entirelywithout neo-classic predecessors.
They turned at times to painting--asthe very word picturesque testifies--for the encouragement they failedto find in literature.
A landscape was picturesque when it seemedlike a picture198 and it might be not merely irregular but savageif it were to seem like some of the pictures of Salvator Rosa.
Thisassociation of even wildness with art is very characteristic ofeighteenth-century sentimentalism.
It is a particular case of thatcurious blending in this period of the old principle of the imitationof models with the new principle of spontaneity.
There was a momentwhen a man needed to show a certain taste for wildness if he was to beconventionally correct.
The fops,” says Taine, describing Rousseau’sinfluence on the drawing-rooms, “dreamt between two madrigals of thehappiness of sleeping naked in the virgin forest.
The prince inGoethe’s “Triumph of Sensibility” has carried with him on his travelscanvas screens so painted that when placed in position they give himthe illusion of being in the midst of a wild landscape.
This taste forartificial wildness can however best be studied in connection with theincreasing vogue in the eighteenth century of the English garden ascompared either with the Italian garden or the French garden in thestyle of Le Nôtre.
199 As a relief from the neo-classical symmetry,nature was broken up, often at great expense, into irregular andunexpected aspects.
Some of the English gardens in France and Germanywere imitated directly from Rousseau’s famous description of thismethod of dealing with the landscape in the “Nouvelle Héloïse.
200Artificial ruins were often placed in the English garden as a furtheraid to those who wished to wander imaginatively from the beaten path,and also as a provocative of the melancholy that was already held tobe distinguished.
Towards the end of the century this cult of ruinswas widespread.
The veritable obsession with ruins that one finds inChateaubriand is not unrelated to this sentimental fashion, thoughit arises even more perhaps from the real ruins that had been soplentifully supplied by the Revolution.
Rousseau himself, it should hardly be necessary to say, stands for farmore than an artificial wildness.
Instead of imposing decorum on naturelike the neo-classicist, he preached constantly the elimination ofdecorum from man.
Man should flee from that “false taste for grandeurwhich is not made for him” and which “poisons his pleasures,”201to nature.
Now “it is on the summits of mountains, in the depths offorests, on deserted islands that nature reveals her most potentcharms.
202 The man of feeling finds the savage and deserted nookfilled with beauties that seem horrible to the mere worldling.
203Rousseau indeed did not crave the ultimate degree of wildness evenin the Alps.
He did not get beyond what one may term the middle zoneof Alpine scenery--scenery that may be found around the shores ofLake Leman.
He was inclined to find the most appropriate setting forthe earthly paradise in the neighborhood of Vevey.
Moreover, othersabout the same time and more or less independently of his influencewere opposing an even more primitive nature to the artificialities ofcivilization.
The mountains of “Ossian” are, as has been said, mereblurs, yet the new delight in mountains is due in no small measurethroughout Europe to the Ossianic influence.
The instinct for getting away from the beaten track, for explorationand discovery, has of course been highly developed at other epochs,notably at the Renaissance.
Much of the romantic interest in the wildand waste places of the earth did not go much beyond what might havebeen felt in Elizabethan England.
Many of the Rousseauists, Wordsworthand Chateaubriand for example, not only read eagerly the older booksof travel but often the same books.
The fascination of penetrating toregions “where foot of man hath ne’er or rarely been,” is perennial.
It was my privilege a few years ago to listen to Sir Ernest Shackletonspeak of his expedition across the Antarctic continent and of thethrill that he and the members of his party felt when they saw risingbefore them day after day mountain peaks that no human eye had evergazed upon.
The emotion was no doubt very similar to that of “stoutCortez” when he first “stared at the Pacific.
Chateaubriand musthave looked forward to similar emotions when he planned his trip toNorth America in search of the North West Passage.
But the passion foractual exploration which is a form of the romanticism of action is verysubordinate in the case of Chateaubriand to emotional romanticism.
Hewent into the wilderness first of all not to make actual discoveriesbut to affirm his freedom from conventional restraint, and at the sametime to practice the new art of revery.
His sentiments on gettinginto what was then the virgin forest to the west of Albany were verydifferent we may assume from those of the early pioneers of America.
When,” he says, “after passing the Mohawk I entered woods whichhad never felt the axe, I was seized by a sort of intoxication ofindependence: I went from tree to tree, to right and left, saying tomyself, ‘Here are no more roads or cities or monarchy or republicor presidents or kings or men.
And in order to find out if I wasrestored to my original rights I did various wilful things that mademy guide furious.
In his heart he believed me mad.
The disillusionthat followed is also one that the early pioneers would have had somedifficulty in understanding.
For he goes on to relate that while hewas thus rejoicing in his escape from conventional life to pure naturehe suddenly bumped up against a shed, and under the shed he saw hisfirst savages--a score of them both men and women.
A little Frenchmannamed M.
Violet, “bepowdered and befrizzled, with an apple-green coat,drugget waistcoat and muslin frill and cuffs, was scraping on a pocketfiddle” and teaching the Indians to dance to the tune of MadelonFriquet.
M.
Violet, it seemed, had remained behind on the departurefrom New York of Rochambeau’s forces at the time of the AmericanRevolution, and had set up as dancing-master among the savages.
Hewas very proud of the nimbleness of his pupils and always referred tothem as “ces messieurs sauvages et ces dames sauvagesses.
Was it nota crushing circumstance for a disciple of Rousseau,” Chateaubriandconcludes, “this introduction to savage life by a ball that theex-scullion of General Rochambeau was giving to Iroquois? I felt verymuch like laughing, but I was at the same time cruelly humiliated.
In America, as elsewhere, Chateaubriand’s chief concern is notwith any outer fact or activity, but with his own emotions and theenhancement of these emotions by his imagination.
In him as in manyother romanticists the different elements of Rousseauism--Arcadianlonging, the pursuit of the dream woman, the aspiration towards the“infinite” (often identified with God)--appear at times more or lessseparately and then again almost inextricably blended with one anotherand with the cult of nature.
It may be well to consider more in detailthese various elements of Rousseauism and their relation to nature inabout the order I have mentioned.
The association of Arcadian longingwith nature is in part an outcome of the conflict between the ideal andthe real.
The romantic idealist finds that men do not understand him:his “vision” is mocked and his “genius” is unrecognized.
The resultis the type of sentimental misanthropy of which I spoke at the end ofthe last chapter.
He feels, as Lamartine says, that there is nothingin common between the world and him.
Lamartine adds, however, “Butnature is there who invites you and loves you.
You will find in herthe comprehension and companionship that you have failed to find insociety.
And nature will seem a perfect companion to the Rousseauistin direct proportion as she is uncontaminated by the presence of man.
Wordsworth has described the misanthropy that supervened in many peopleon the collapse of the revolutionary idealism.
He himself overcameit, though there is more than a suggestion in the manner of his ownretirement into the hills of a man who retreats into an Arcadian dreamfrom actual defeat.
The suggestion of defeat is much stronger inRuskin’s similar retirement.
Ruskin doubtless felt in later life, likeRousseau, that if he had failed to get on with men “it was less hisfault than theirs.
204 Perhaps emotional misanthropy and the worshipof wild nature are nowhere more fully combined than in Byron.
Hegives magnificent expression to the most untenable of paradoxes--thatone escapes from solitude by eschewing human haunts in favor of somewilderness.
205 In these haunts, he says, he became like a “falconwith clipped wing,” but found in nature the kindest of mothers.
Oh! she is fairest in her features wild,      Where nothing polished dare pollute her path:      To me by day or night she ever smiled      Though I have marked her when none other hath    And sought her more and more, and loved her best in wrath.
206He not only finds companionship in nature but at the same time partakesof her infinitude--an infinitude, one should note, of feeling:    I live not in myself, but I become    Portion of that around me; and to me    High mountains are a feeling, but the hum    Of human cities torture.
207In his less misanthropic moods the Rousseauist sees in wild naturenot only a refuge from society, but also a suitable setting for hiscompanionship with the ideal mate, for what the French term lasolitude à deux.
Oh! that the Desert were my dwelling-place    With one fair Spirit for my minister,    That I might all forget the human race    And, hating no one, love but only her!208The almost innumerable passages in the romantic movement that celebratethis Arcadian companionship in the wilderness merely continue in asense the pastoral mood that must be as old as human nature itself.
But in the past the pastoral mood has been comparatively placid.
It has not been associated in any such degree with misanthropy andwildness, with nympholeptic longing and the thirst for the infinite.
The scene that Chateaubriand has imagined between Chactas and Atala inthe primeval forest, is surely the stormiest of Arcadias; so stormyindeed that it would have been unintelligible to Theocritus.
It isnot certain that it would have been intelligible to Shakespeare, wholike the other Elizabethans felt at times that he too had been bornin Arcadia.
The Arcadian of the past was much less inclined to sinkdown to the subrational and to merge his personality in the landscape.
Rousseau describes with a charm that has scarcely been surpassed byany of his disciples, the reveries in which he thus descends belowthe level of his rational self.
Time, no longer broken up by theimportunate intellect and its analysis, is then felt by him in itsunbroken flow; the result is a sort of “eternal present that leavesno sense of emptiness.
Of such a moment of revery Rousseau says,anticipating Faust, that he “would like it to last forever.
Bergsonin his conception of the summum bonum as a state in which time isno longer cut up into artificial segments but is perceived in itscontinuous stream as a “present that endures,”209 has done littlemore than repeat Rousseau.
The sight and sound of water seem to havebeen a special aid to revery in Rousseau’s case.
His accounts of thesemi-dissolution of his conscious self that he enjoyed while driftingidly on the Lake of Bienne are justly celebrated.
Lamartine’s soul was,like that of Rousseau, lulled by “the murmur of waters.
Nothing againis more Rousseauistic than the desire Arnold attributes to Maurice deGuérin--the desire “to be borne on forever down an enchanted stream.
That too is why certain passages of Shelley are so near in spirit toRousseau--for example, the boat revery in “Prometheus Unbound” in whichan Arcadian nature and the dream companion mingle to the strains ofmusic in a way that is supremely romantic.
210The association of nature with Arcadian longing and the pursuit ofthe dream woman is even less significant than its association withthe idea of the infinite.
For as a result of this latter associationthe nature cult often assumes the aspect of a religion.
The variousassociations may indeed as I have said be very much blended or elsemay run into one another almost insensibly.
No better illustration ofthis blending can be found perhaps than in Chateaubriand--especiallyin that compendium of Rousseauistic psychology, his “René.
The soulof René, one learns, was too great to adjust itself to the society ofmen.
He found that he would have to contract his life if he put himselfon their level.
Men, for their part, treated him as a dreamer, and sohe is forced more and more by his increasing disgust for them intosolitude.
Now René rests the sense of his superiority over other menon two things: first, on his superlative capacity to feel grief;211secondly, on his thirst for the infinite.
What is finite,” he says,“has no value for me.
What is thus pushing him beyond all bounds is“an unknown good of which the instinct pursues me.
I began to askmyself what I desired.
I did not know but I thought all of a suddenthat the woods would be delicious to me!” What he found in this questfor the mystical something that was to fill the abyss of his existencewas the dream woman.
I went down into the valley, I strode upon themountain, summoning with all the force of my desire the ideal objectof a future flame; I embraced this object in the winds; I thoughtthat I heard it in the moanings of the river.
All was this phantom ofthe imagination--both the stars in heaven and the very principle oflife in the universe.
I have already quoted a very similar passageand pointed out the equivalent in Shelley.
No such close equivalentcould be found in Byron, and Wordsworth, it is scarcely necessary tosay, offers no equivalent at all.
If one reads on, however, one findspassages that are Byronic and others that are Wordsworthian.
Paganism,Chateaubriand complains, by seeing in nature only certain definiteforms--fauns and satyrs and nymphs--had banished from it both God andthe infinite.
But Christianity expelled these thronging figures inturn and restored to the grottoes their silence and to the woods theirrevery.
The true God thus became visible in his works and bestowedupon them his own immensity.
What Chateaubriand understands by God andthe infinite appears in the following description of the region nearNiagara seen by moonlight.
The passage is Byronic as a whole with aWordsworthian touch at the end.
The grandeur, the amazing melancholyof this picture cannot be expressed in human language; the fairestnight of Europe can give no conception of it.
In vain in our cultivatedfields does the imagination seek to extend itself.
It encounters onevery hand the habitations of men; but in these savage regions the soultakes delight in plunging into an ocean of forests, in hovering overthe gulf of cataracts, in meditating on the shores of lakes and riversand, so to speak, in finding itself alone in the presence of God.
Therelation between wild and solitary nature and the romantic idea of theinfinite is here obvious.
It is an aid to the spirit in throwing offits limitations and so in feeling itself “free.
212A greater spiritual elevation it is sometimes asserted is found inWordsworth’s communings with nature than in those of Rousseau andChateaubriand.
The difference perhaps is less one of spirit thanof temperament.
In its abdication of the intellectual and criticalfaculties, in its semi-dissolution of the conscious self, therevery of Wordsworth does not differ from that of Rousseau213 andChateaubriand, but the erotic element is absent.
In the “Genius ofChristianity” Chateaubriand gives a magnificent description of sunsetat sea and turns the whole picture into a proof of God.
Elsewhere hetells us that it was “not God alone that I contemplated on the watersin the splendor of his works.
I saw an unknown woman and the miracleof her smile.
I should have sold eternity for one of her caresses.
I imagined that she was palpitating behind that veil of the universethat hid her from my eyes,” etc.
Wordsworth was at least consistentlyreligious in his attitude towards the landscape: he did not see in itat one moment God, and at another an unknown woman and the miracle ofher smile.
At the same time his idea of spirituality is very remotefrom the traditional conception.
Formerly spirituality was held to be aprocess of recollection, of gathering one’s self in, that is, towardsthe centre and not of diffusive emotion; so that when a man wishedto pray he retired into his closet, and did not, like a Wordsworthor a Rousseau, fall into an inarticulate ecstasy before the wondersof nature.
As for the poets of the past, they inclined as a rule tolook on nature as an incentive not to religion but to love.
Keble,following Wordsworth, protests on this ground against Aristophanes, andCatullus and Horace and Theocritus.
He might have lengthened the listalmost indefinitely.
Chateaubriand bids us in our devotional moods tobetake ourselves “to the religious forest.
La Fontaine is at leastas near to normal human experience and also at least as poetical whenhe warns “fair ones” to “fear the depths of the woods and their vastsilence.
214No one would question that Wordsworth has passages of great ethicalelevation.
But in some of these passages he simply renews the errorof the Stoics who also display at times great ethical elevation; heascribes to the natural order virtues that the natural order does notgive.
This error persists to some extent even when he is turning away,as in the “Ode to Duty,” from the moral spontaneity of the Rousseauist.
It is not quite clear that the law of duty in the breast of man is thesame law that preserves “the stars from wrong.
His earlier assertionthat the light of setting suns and the mind of man are identical intheir essence is at best highly speculative, at least as speculativeas the counter assertion of Sir Thomas Browne that “there is surely apiece of divinity in us; something that was before the elements, andowes no homage unto the sun.
Furthermore this latter sense of the gapbetween man and nature seems to be more fully justified by its fruitsin life and conduct, and this is after all the only test that counts inthe long run.
One of the reasons why pantheistic revery has been so popular is thatit seems to offer a painless substitute for genuine spiritual effort.
In its extreme exponents, a Rousseau or a Walt Whitman, it amounts to asort of ecstatic animality that sets up as a divine illumination.
Evenin its milder forms it encourages one to assume a tone of consecrationin speaking of experiences that are æsthetic rather than trulyreligious.
Tis only heaven that’s given away,” sings Lowell; “’Tisonly God may be had for the asking.
God and heaven are accorded byLowell with such strange facility because he identifies them with theluxurious enjoyment of a “day in June.
When pushed to a certain pointthe nature cult always tends towards sham spirituality.
Oh World as God has made it      --All is beauty,    And knowing this is love, and      Love is duty.
It seems to follow from these verses of Browning, perhaps the mostflaccid spiritually in the English language, that to go out and mixone’s self up with the landscape is the same as doing one’s duty.
Asa method of salvation this is even easier and more æsthetic than thatof the Ancient Mariner, who, it will be remembered, is relieved of theburden of his transgression by admiring the color of water-snakes!The nature cult arose at a time when the traditional religioussymbols were becoming incredible.
Instead of working out new andfirm distinctions between good and evil, the Rousseauist seeks todiscredit all precise distinctions whether new or old, in favor of mereemotional intoxication.
The passage to which I have already alluded,in which Faust breaks down the scruples of Marguerite by proclaimingthe supremacy of feeling, surpasses even the lines I have cited fromBrowning as an example of sham spirituality:    Marguerite:    Dost thou believe in God?    Faust:    My darling, who dares say,    Yes, I in God believe?    Question or priest or sage, and they    Seem, in the answer you receive,    To mock the questioner.
Marguerite:    Then thou dost not believe?    Faust:    Sweet one! my meaning do not misconceive!    Him who dare name    And who proclaim,    Him I believe?    Who that can feel,    His heart can steel    To say: I believe him not?    The All-embracer,    All-sustainer,    Holds and sustains he not    Thee, me, himself?    Lifts not the Heaven its dome above?    Doth not the firm-set earth beneath us lie?    And beaming tenderly with looks of love    Climb not the everlasting stars on high?    Do I not gaze into thine eyes?    Nature’s impenetrable agencies,    Are they not thronging on thy heart and brain,    Viewless, or visible to mortal ken,    Around thee weaving their mysterious chain?    Fill thence thy heart, how large soe’er it be;    And in the feeling when thou utterly art blest,    Then call it what thou wilt--    Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God!    I have no name for it!    Feeling is all;    Name is but sound and smoke    Shrouding the glow of heaven.
215The upshot of this enthusiasm that overflows all boundaries and spurnsdefinition as mere smoke that veils its heavenly glow is the seductionof a poor peasant girl.
Such is the romantic contrast between the“ideal” and the “real.
Those to whom I may seem to be treating the nature cult withundue severity should remember that I am treating it only in itspseudo-religious aspect.
In its proper place all this refining onman’s relation to the “outworld” may be legitimate and delightful;but that place is secondary.
My quarrel is only with the æsthete whoassumes an apocalyptic pose and gives forth as a profound philosophywhat is at best only a holiday or week-end view of existence.
Nodistinction is more important for any one who wishes to maintain acorrect scale of values than that between what is merely recreative andwhat ministers to leisure.
There are times when we may properly seeksolace and renewal in nature, when we may invite both our souls and ourbodies to loaf.
The error is to look on these moments of recreationand relief from concentration on some definite end as in themselvesthe consummation of wisdom.
Rousseau indeed assumes that his art ofmixing himself up with the landscape is identical with leisure; likeinnumerable disciples he confuses revery with meditation--a confusionso grave that I shall need to revert to it later.
He parodies subtlywhat is above the ordinary rational level in terms of what is below it.
He thus brings under suspicion the most necessary of all truths--thatthe kingdom of heaven is within us.
The first place always belongs to action and purpose and not to mereidling, even if it be like that of the Rousseauist transcendentalidling.
The man who makes a deliberate choice and then plans his lifewith reference to it is less likely than the aimless man to be swayedby every impulse and impression.
The figures of Raphael according toHazlitt have always “a set, determined, voluntary character,” they“want that wild uncertainty of expression which is connected with theaccidents of nature and the changes of the elements.
And Hazlitttherefore concludes rightly that Raphael has “nothing romantic abouthim.
The distinction is so important that it might be made thebasis for a comparison between the painting of the Renaissance andsome of the important schools of the nineteenth century.
Here againno sensible person would maintain that the advantage is all on oneside.
Romanticism gave a great impulse to landscape painting and tothe painting of man in the landscape.
Few romantic gains are moreindubitable.
One may prefer the best work of the Barbizon school forexample to the contemporary product in French literature.
But even hereit must be insisted that painting from which man is absent or in whichhe is more or less subordinated to the landscape is not the highesttype of painting.
Turner, one of the greatest masters of landscape,was almost incapable of painting the human figure.
Ruskin is thereforeindulging in romantic paradox when he puts Turner in the same classas Shakespeare.
Turner’s vision of life as compared with that ofShakespeare is not central but peripheral.
The revolution that has resulted from the triumph of naturalistic overhumanistic tendencies in painting extends down to the minutest detailsof technique; it has meant the subordination of design--the imposition,that is, on one’s material of a firm central purpose--to light andcolor; and this in painting corresponds to the literary pursuit ofglamour and illusion for their own sake.
It has meant in general atendency to sacrifice all the other elements of painting to the captureof the vivid and immediate impression.
And this corresponds to thereadiness of the writer to forego decorum in favor of intensity.
Thechoice that is involved, including a choice of technique, accordingas one is a naturalist or a humanist, is brought out by Mr. Kenyon Coxin his comparison of two paintings of hermits,216 one by Titian andone by John Sargent: the impressionistic and pantheistic hermit ofSargent is almost entirely merged in the landscape; he is little morethan a pretext for a study of the accidents of light.
The conceptionof Titian’s St.
Jerome in the Desert is perhaps even more humanisticthan religious.
The figure of the saint on which everything convergesis not merely robust, it is even a bit robustious.
The picture affirmsin its every detail the superior importance of man and his purposes tohis natural environment.
So far as their inner life is concerned thetwo hermits are plainly moving in opposite directions.
An appropriatemotto for Sargent’s hermit would be the following lines that I takefrom a French symbolist, but the equivalent of which can be found ininnumerable other Rousseauists:    Je voudrais me confondre avec les chases, tordre    Mes bras centre la pierre et les fraîches écorces,    Etre l’arbre, le mur, le pollen et le sel,    Et me dissoudre au fond de l’être universel.
This is to push the reciprocity between man and nature to a pointwhere the landscape is not only a state of the soul but the soul isa state of the landscape; just as in Shelley’s Ode, Shelley becomesthe West Wind and the West Wind becomes Shelley.
217 The changes inthe romantic soul are appropriately mirrored in the changes of theseasons.
In Tieck’s “Genoveva,” for example, Golo’s love blossoms inthe springtime, the sultry summer impels him to sinful passion, theautumn brings grief and repentance, and in winter avenging judgmentovertakes the offender and casts him into the grave.
218 Autumnis perhaps even more than springtime the favorite season of theRousseauist.
The movement is filled with souls who like the hero ofPoe’s “Ulalume” have reached the October of their sensations.
Sometraces of this sympathetic relation between man and nature may indeedbe found in the literature of the past.
The appropriateness of thesetting in the “Prometheus Bound” of Æschylus would scarcely seem tobe an accident.
The storm in “Lear” may also be instanced.
But as Ihave already said occidental man did not before Rousseau show muchinclination to mingle with the landscape.
The parallelism that Paterestablishes in “Marius the Epicurean” between the moods of the hero andthe shifting aspects of nature is felt as a distinct anachronism.
If wewish to find any early approximations to the subtleties and refinementsof the Rousseauist in his dealings with nature we need to turn to theFar East--especially to the Taoist movement in China.
219 As a resultof the Taoist influence China had from a very early period poets andpainters for whom the landscape is very plainly a state of the soul.
Pantheistic revery of the kind I have been describing leads inevitablyto a special type of symbolism.
The Rousseauist reads into natureunutterable love.
He sees shining through its finite forms the light ofthe infinite.
The Germans especially set out to express symbolicallythe relationship between the love and infinitude that they saw innature and the kindred elements in themselves.
Any one who hasattempted to thread his way through the German theories of the symbolwill feel that he has, like Wordsworth’s shepherd, “been in the heartof many thousand mists.
But in view of the importance of the subjectit is necessary to venture for a moment into this metaphysical murk.
Schelling’s “Nature Philosophy” is perhaps the most ambitious of allthe German attempts to run together symbolically the human spirit andphenomenal nature.
What we call nature,” says Schelling, “is a poemthat lies hidden in a secret wondrous writing”; if the riddle could berevealed we should recognize in nature “the Odyssey of the Spirit.
There looks out through sensuous objects as through a half-transparentmist the world of phantasy for which we long.
All things are only agarment of the world of spirit.
To be romantic,” says Uhland, “isto have an inkling of the infinite in appearances.
Beauty,” saysSchelling in similar vein, “is a finite rendering of the infinite.
Nowthe infinite and the finite can only be thus brought together throughthe medium of the symbol.
Therefore, as A.
W.
Schlegel says, “beautyis a symbolical representation of the infinite.
All poetry is aneverlasting symbolizing.
This assertion is in an important sense true.
Unfortunately thereremains the ambiguity that I have already pointed out in the word“infinite.
No one would give a high rating to a certain type ofallegory that flourished in neo-classical times as also in a somewhatdifferent form during the Middle Ages.
It is a cold intellectualcontrivance in which the imagination has little part and whichtherefore fails to suggest the infinite in any sense.
But touniversalize the particular in the classical sense is to give accessimaginatively to the human infinite that is set above nature.
Everysuccessful humanistic creation is more or less symbolical.
Othello isnot merely a jealous man; he is also a symbol of jealousy.
Some of themyths of Plato again are imaginative renderings of a supersensuousrealm to which man has no direct access.
They are symbolicalrepresentations of an infinite that the romanticist leaves out ofhis reckoning.
The humanistic and spiritual symbols that abound inthe religion and poetry of the past, are then, it would seem, verydifferent from the merely æsthetic symbolizing of a Schelling.
ForSchelling is one of the chief of those who from Shaftesbury down havetended to identify beauty and truth and to make both purely æsthetic.
But a symbol that is purely æsthetic, that is in other words purely amatter of feeling, rests on what is constantly changing not only fromman to man but in the same man.
Romantic symbolism, therefore, thoughit claims at one moment to be scientific (especially in Germany) and atanother moment to have a religious value, is at bottom the symbolizingof mood.
Both the imagination and the emotion that enter into theromantic symbol are undisciplined.
The results of such a symbolism donot meet the demand of the genuine man of science for experimentalproof, they do not again satisfy the test of universality imposed bythose who believe in a distinctively human realm that is set abovenature.
The nature philosophy of a Schelling leads therefore on the onehand to sham science and on the other to sham philosophy and religion.
The genuine man of science has as a matter of fact repudiated thespeculations of Schelling and other romantic physicists as fantastic.
He may also be counted on to look with suspicion on the speculationsof a Bergson who, more perhaps than any living Rousseauist, remindsone of the German romantic philosophers.
One idea has however lingeredin the mind even of the genuine man of science as a result of all thisromantic theorizing--namely that man has access to the infinite onlythrough nature.
Thus Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn said in a recentaddress to the students of Columbia University:    I would not for a moment take advantage of the present    opportunity to discourage the study of human nature and of    the humanities, but for what is called the best opening for    a constructive career give me nature.
The ground for my    preference is that human nature is an exhaustible fountain    of research; Homer understood it well; Solomon fathomed    it; Shakespeare divined it, both normal and abnormal;    the modernists have been squeezing out the last drops of    abnormality.
Nature, studied since Aristotle’s time, is    still full to the brim; no perceptible falling of its tides    is evident from any point at which it is attacked, from    nebulæ to protoplasm; it is always wholesome, refreshing and    invigorating.
Of the two most creative literary artists of our    time, Maeterlinck, jaded with human abnormality, comes back to    the bee and the flowers and the “blue bird,” with a delicious    renewal of youth, while Rostand turns to the barnyard.
The romanticists acted from the start, following here in the wake ofthe pseudo-classicists, on Professor Osborn’s assumption that normalhuman nature is something that may be bottled up once for all and putby on a shelf, though they would have been pained to learn from himthat even abnormal human nature may also be bottled up and put by inthe same fashion.
Sophistries of this kind should perhaps be pardonedin the man of science when so many men who are supposed to stand forletters have shown him the way.
Great literature is an imaginative andsymbolical interpretation of an infinite that is accessible only tothose who possess in some degree the same type of imagination.
A writerlike Maeterlinck, whom Professor Osborn takes to be representative ofliterature in general, is merely a late exponent of a movement thatfrom the start turned away from this human infinite towards pantheisticrevery.
The imagination is, as Coleridge says, the great unifying power; itdraws together things that are apparently remote.
But its analogies tobe of value should surely have validity apart from the mere shiftingmood of the man who perceives them.
Otherwise he simply wrests someouter object from the chain of cause and effect of which it is actuallya part, and incorporates it arbitrarily into his own private dream.
Wordsworth is not sparing of homely detail in his account of hisleech-gatherer; but at a given moment in this poem the leech-gathererundergoes a strange transformation; he loses all verisimilitude as aleech-gatherer and becomes a romantic symbol, a mere projection, thatis, of the poet’s own broodings.
To push this symbolizing of moodbeyond a certain point is incipient hallucination.
We are told thatwhen the asylum at Charenton was shelled in the Franco-Prussian Warof 1870, the lunatics saw reflected in the bursting bombs, each ina different way, his own madness.
One took the bombs to be a link inthe plot of his enemies against him, etc.
It is hard to consider thesymbolizing and visions of the extreme romanticist, such as those ofWilliam Blake, without thinking at times of Charenton.
What I have said of the romantic symbol is true in some degree ofthe romantic metaphor, for the symbol and even the myth are oftenonly a developed metaphor.
The first part of the romantic metaphor,the image or impression that has been received from the outer world,is often admirably fresh and vivid.
220 But the second part of themetaphor when the analogy involved is that between some fact of outerperception and the inner life of man is often vague and misty; for theinner life in which the romanticist takes interest is not the lifehe possesses in common with other men but what is most unique in hisown emotions--his mood in short.
That is why the metaphor and stillmore the symbol in so far as they are romantic are always in danger ofbecoming unintelligible, since it is not easy for one man to enter intoanother’s mood.
Men accord a ready welcome to metaphors and symbolsthat instead of expressing something more or less individual have areal relevancy to their common nature.
Tribulation, for example, meansliterally the beating out of grain on the threshing floor.
The manwho first saw the analogy between this process and certain spiritualexperiences established a legitimate link between nature and humannature, between sense and the supersensuous.
Language is filled withwords and expressions of this kind which have become so current thattheir metaphorical and symbolical character has been forgotten andwhich have at the same time ceased to be vivid and concrete and becomeabstract.
The primitivistic fallacies of the German romanticists in theirdealings with the symbol and metaphor appear in various forms inFrench romanticism and even more markedly in its continuation knownas the symbolistic movement.
What is exasperating in many of thepoets of this school is that they combine the pretence to a vastillumination with the utmost degree of spiritual and intellectualemptiness and vagueness.
Like the early German romanticists they mixup flesh and spirit in nympholeptic longing and break down and blurall the boundaries of being in the name of the infinite.
Of this innerformlessness and anarchy the chaos of the vers libre (in which theywere also anticipated by the Germans) is only an outer symptom.
221If the Rousseauistic primitivist recognizes the futility of hissymbolizing, and consents to become a passive register of outerperception, if for example he proclaims himself an imagist, he at leasthas the merit of frankness, but in that case he advertises by the veryname he has assumed the bankruptcy of all that is most worth while inpoetry.
But to return to romanticism and nature.
It should be plain from whathas already been said that the romanticist tends to make of nature themere plaything of his mood.
When Werther’s mood is cheerful, naturesmiles at him benignly.
When his mood darkens she becomes for him “adevouring monster.
When it grows evident to the romanticist thatnature does not alter with his alteration, he chides her at times forher impassibility; or again he seeks to be impassible like her, even ifhe can be so only at the expense of his humanity.
This latter attitudeis closely connected with the dehumanizing of man by science that isreflected in a whole literature during the last half of the nineteenthcentury--for instance, in so-called “impassive” writers like Flaubertand Leconte de Lisle.
The causal sequences that had been observed in the physical realmwere developed more and more during this period with the aid of puremathematics and the mathematical reason (esprit de géométrie) into anall-embracing system.
For the earlier romanticists nature had at leastbeen a living presence whether benign or sinister.
For the mathematicaldeterminist she tends to become a soulless, pitiless mechanism againstwhich man is helpless.
222 This conception of nature is so importantthat I shall need to revert to it in my treatment of melancholy.
The man who has accepted the universe of the mechanist or deterministis not always gloomy.
But men in general felt the need of some relieffrom the deterministic obsession.
Hence the success of the philosophyof Bergson and similar philosophies.
The glorification of impulse(élan vital) that Bergson opposes to the mechanizing of life is inits main aspects, as I have already indicated, simply a return tothe spontaneity of Rousseau.
His plan of escape from deterministicscience is at bottom very much like Rousseau’s plan of escape fromthe undue rationalism of the Enlightenment.
As a result of theseeighteenth-century influences, nature had, according to Carlyle, becomea mere engine, a system of cogs and pulleys.
He therefore hails Novalisas an “anti-mechanist,” a “deep man,” because of the way of deliverancethat he teaches from this nightmare.
I owe him somewhat.
What Carlyleowed to Novalis many moderns have owed to Bergson, but it is not yetclear that either Novalis or Bergson are “deep men.
The mechanistic view of nature, whether held pessimistically oroptimistically, involving as it does factors that are infiniteand therefore beyond calculation, cannot furnish proofs that willsatisfy the true positivist: he is inclined to dismiss it as a merephantasmagoria of the intellect.
The Rousseauistic view of nature, onthe other hand, whether held optimistically or pessimistically, iseven less capable of satisfying the standards of the positivist andmust be dismissed as a mere phantasmagoria of the emotions.
The factis that we do not know and can never know what nature is in herself.
The mysterious mother has shrouded herself from us in an impenetrableveil of illusion.
But though we cannot know nature absolutely we canpick up a practical and piecemeal knowledge of nature not by dreamingbut by doing.
The man of action can within certain limits have his waywith nature.
Now the men who have acted during the past century havebeen the men of science and the utilitarians who have been turningto account the discoveries of science.
The utilitarians have indeedderived such potent aid from science that they have been able to stamptheir efforts on the very face of the landscape.
The romanticists havenot ceased to protest against this scientific utilizing of nature asa profanation.
But inasmuch as these protests have come from men whohave stood not for work but for revery they have for the most partbeen futile.
This is not the least of the ironic contrasts that aboundin this movement between the ideal and the real.
No age ever grew soecstatic over natural beauty as the nineteenth century, at the sametime no age ever did so much to deface nature.
No age ever so exaltedthe country over the town, and no age ever witnessed such a crowdinginto urban centres.
A curious study might be made of this ironic contrast as it appearsin the early romantic crusade against railways.
One of the romanticgrievances against the railway is that it does not encouragevagabondage: it has a definite goal and gets to it so far as possiblein a straight line.
Yet in spite of Wordsworth’s protesting sonnet theWindermere railway was built.
Ruskin’s wrath at railways was equallyvain.
In general, sentiment is not of much avail when pitted againstindustrial advance.
The papers announced recently that one of theloveliest cascades in the California Sierras had suddenly disappearedas a result of the diversion of its water to a neighboring power-plant.
The same fate is overtaking Niagara itself.
It is perhaps symbolicthat a quarry has made a hideous gash in the hillside on the shores ofRydal Mere right opposite Wordsworth’s house.
If the man of science and the utilitarian do not learn what natureis in herself they learn at least to adjust themselves to forcesoutside themselves.
The Rousseauist, on the other hand, does not inhis “communion” with nature adjust himself to anything.
He is simplycommuning with his own mood.
Rousseau chose appropriately as title forthe comedy that was his first literary effort “Narcissus or the Loverof Himself.
The nature over which the Rousseauist is bent in such raptcontemplation plays the part of the pool in the legend of Narcissus.
Itrenders back to him his own image.
He sees in nature what he himselfhas put there.
The Rousseauist transfuses himself into nature in muchthe same way that Pygmalion transfuses himself into his statue.
Natureis dead, as Rousseau says, unless animated by the fires of love.
Makeno mistake,” says M.
Masson, “the nature that Jean-Jacques worshipsis only a projection of Jean-Jacques.
He has poured himself forthso complacently upon it that he can always find himself and cherishhimself in it.
And M.
Masson goes on and quotes from a curious andlittle-known fragment of Rousseau: “Beloved solitude,” Rousseau sighs,“beloved solitude, where I still pass with pleasure the remains ofa life given over to suffering.
Forest with stunted trees, marsheswithout water, broom, reeds, melancholy heather, inanimate objects,you who can neither speak to me nor hear me, what secret charm bringsme back constantly into your midst? Unfeeling and dead things, thischarm is not in you; it could not be there.
It is in my own heart whichwishes to refer back everything to itself.
223 Coleridge plainly onlycontinues Rousseau when he writes:    O Lady! we receive but what we give,    And in our life alone does nature live:224    Ours is her wedding-garment, ours her shroud!      And would we aught behold, of higher worth,    Than that inanimate cold world allow’d    To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd,      Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth    A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud      Enveloping the Earth.
The fair luminous cloud is no other than the Arcadian imagination.
Thelight that never was on sea or land, the consecration and the poet’sdream” of which Wordsworth speaks, is likewise as appears very plainlyfrom the context,225 Arcadian.
He should once, Wordsworth writes,have wished to see Peele Castle bathed in the Arcadian light, but nowthat he has escaped by sympathy for his fellow-men from the Arcadianaloofness, he is willing that it should be painted in storm.
Merestorminess, one should recollect, is not in itself an assurance thatone has turned from the romantic dream to reality.
One finds in thismovement, if nowhere else, as I remarked apropos of Chateaubriand, thestormy Arcadia.
It is not through the Arcadian imagination that one moves towardsreality.
This does not much matter if what one seeks in a “return tonature” is merely recreation.
I cannot repeat too often that I have noquarrel with the nature cult when it remains recreative but only whenit sets up as a substitute for philosophy and religion.
This involvesa confusion between the two main directions of the human spirit, aconfusion as I have said in a previous chapter between the realm ofawe and the region of wonder.
Pascal exaggerates somewhat when he saysthe Bible never seeks to prove religion from the “wonders” of nature.
But this remark is true to the total spirit of the Bible.
A knowledgeof the flowers of the Holy Land is less necessary for an understandingof the gospel narrative than one might suppose from Renan.
226 Renanis simply seeking to envelop Jesus so far as possible in an Arcadianatmosphere.
In so doing he is following in the footsteps of the greatfather of sentimentalists.
According to M.
Masson, Jesus, as depictedby Jean-Jacques, becomes “a sort of grand master of the Golden Age.
Here as elsewhere the Rousseauist is seeking to identify the Arcadianview of life with wisdom.
The result is a series of extraordinarilysubtle disguises for egoism.
We think we see the Rousseauist prostratebefore the ideal woman or before nature or before God himself, butwhen we look more closely we see that he is only (as Sainte-Beuve saidof Alfred de Vigny) “in perpetual adoration before the holy sacramentof himself.
The fact that he finds in nature only what he has putthere seems to be for Rousseau himself a source of satisfaction.
Butthe poem of Coleridge I have just quoted, in which he proclaims that sofar as nature is concerned “we receive but what we give,” is entitled“Ode to Dejection.
One of man’s deepest needs would seem to be forgenuine communion, for a genuine escape, that is, from his ordinaryself.
The hollowness of the Rousseauistic communion with nature aswell as other Rousseauistic substitutes for genuine communion isindissolubly bound up with the subject of romantic melancholy.
CHAPTER IXROMANTIC MELANCHOLYRousseau and his early followers--especially perhaps his early Frenchfollowers--were very much preoccupied with the problem of happiness.
Now in a sense all men--even those who renounce the world and mortifythe flesh--aim at happiness.
The important point to determine is whatany particular person means by happiness and how he hopes to attain it.
It should be plain from all that has been said that the Rousseauistseeks happiness in the free play of the emotions.
The “Influence ofthe Passions on Happiness” is the significant title of one of Madamede Staël’s early treatises.
The happiness that the Rousseauist seeksinvolves not merely a free play of feeling but--what is even moreimportant--a free play of the imagination.
Feeling acquires a sortof infinitude as a result of this coöperation of the imagination,and so the romanticist goes, as we have seen, in quest of the thrillsuperlative, as appears so clearly in his nympholepsy, his pursuit ofthe “impossible she.
But the more imaginative this quest for emotionalhappiness grows the more it tends to become a mere nostalgia.
Happinessis achieved so far as it is achieved at all in dreamland.
Rousseau saysof himself: Mon plus constant bonheur fut en songe.
Every finitesatisfaction by the very fact that it is finite leaves him unsatisfied.
René says that he had exhausted solitude as he had exhausted society:they had both failed to satisfy his insatiable desires.
René plainlytakes his insatiableness to be the badge of his spiritual distinction.
To submit to any circumscribing of one’s desires is to show thatone has no sense of infinitude and so to sink to the level of thephilistine.
But does one become happy by being nostalgic and hyperæsthetic, byburning with infinite indeterminate desire? We have here perhaps thechief irony and contradiction in the whole movement.
The Rousseauistseeks happiness and yet on his own showing, his mode of seeking itresults, not in happiness but in wretchedness.
One finds indeed figuresin the nineteenth century, a Browning, for example, who see in lifefirst of all an emotional adventure and then carry this adventurethrough to the end with an apparently unflagging gusto.
One may affirmnevertheless that a movement which began by asserting the goodnessof man and the loveliness of nature ended by producing the greatestliterature of despair the world has ever seen.
No movement has perhapsbeen so prolific of melancholy as emotional romanticism.
To follow itfrom Rousseau down to the present day is to run through the whole gamutof gloom.
227    Infections of unutterable sadness,    Infections of incalculable madness,      Infections of incurable despair.
According to a somewhat doubtful authority, Ninon de Lenclos, “thejoy of the spirit measures its force.
When the romanticist on theother hand discovers that his ideal of happiness works put into actualunhappiness he does not blame his ideal.
He simply assumes that theworld is unworthy of a being so exquisitely organized as himself, andso shrinks back from it and enfolds himself in his sorrow as he wouldin a mantle.
Since the superlative bliss that he craves eludes himhe will at least be superlative in woe.
So far from being a mark offailure this woe measures his spiritual grandeur.
A great soul,” asRené says, “must contain more grief than a small one.
The romanticpoets enter into a veritable competition with one another as to whoshall be accounted the most forlorn.
The victor in this competitionis awarded the palm not merely for poetry but wisdom.
In the words ofArnold:            Amongst us one      Who most has suffered, takes dejectedly    His seat upon the intellectual throne;      And all his store of sad experience he        Lays bare of wretched days.
Tells us his misery’s birth and growth and signs,      And how the dying spark of hope was fed,      And how the breast was soothed, and how the head,    And all his hourly varied anodynes.
This for our wisest! and we others pine,      And wish the long unhappy dream would end,        And waive all claim to bliss, and try to bear;    With close-lipped patience for our only friend,        Sad patience, too near neighbor to despair.
Though Arnold may in this poem, as some one has complained, reduce themuse to the rôle of hospital nurse, he is, like his master Senancour,free from the taint of theatricality.
He does not as he said of Byronmake “a pageant of his bleeding heart”; and the Byronic pose has aclose parallel in the pose of Chateaubriand.
An Irish girl at Londononce told Chateaubriand that “he carried his heart in a sling.
Hehimself said that he had a soul of the kind “the ancients called asacred malady.
Chateaubriand, to be sure, had his cheerful moments and many of them.
His sorrows he bestowed upon the public.
Herein he was a true childof Jean-Jacques.
We are told by eye-witnesses how heartily Rousseauenjoyed many aspects of his life at Motiers-Travers.
On his ownshowing, he was plunged during this period in almost unalloyed misery.
Froude writes of Carlyle: “It was his peculiarity that if matters werewell with himself, it never occurred to him that they could be goingill with any one else; and, on the other hand, if he was uncomfortable,he required everybody to be uncomfortable along with him.
We canfollow clear down to Gissing the assumption in some form or other that“art must be the mouthpiece of misery.
This whole question as to theproper function of art goes to the root of the debate between theclassicist and the Rousseauist.
All these poets,” Goethe complains toEckermann of the romanticists of 1830, “write as though they were ill,and as though the whole world were a hospital.
Every one of them inwriting tries to be more desolate than all the others.
This is reallyan abuse of poetry which has been given to make man satisfied with theworld and with his lot.
But the present generation is afraid of allsolid energy; its mind is at ease and sees poetry only in weakness.
Ihave found a good expression to vex these gentlemen.
I am going to calltheir poetry hospital poetry.
228Now Goethe is here, like Chateaubriand, mocking to some degree his ownfollowers.
When he suffered from a spiritual ailment of any kind he gotrid of it by inoculating others with it; and it was in this way, as welearn from his Autobiography, that he got relief from the Weltschmerzof “Werther.
But later in life Goethe was classical not merely inprecept like Chateaubriand, but to some extent in practice.
The best ofthe poetry of his maturity tends like that of the ancients to elevateand console.
The contrast between classic and romantic poetry in this matter ofmelancholy is closely bound up with the larger contrast betweenimitation and spontaneity.
Homer is the greatest of poets, accordingto Aristotle, because he does not entertain us with his own person butis more than any other poet an imitator.
The romantic poet writes, onthe other hand, as Lamartine says he wrote, solely for the “relief ofhis heart.
He pours forth himself--his most intimate and private self;above all, his anguish and his tears.
In his relation to his reader, asMusset tells us in a celebrated image,229 he is like the pelican whorends and lacerates his own flesh to provide nourishment for his young(Pour toute nourriture il apporte son cœur):    Les plus désespérés sont les chants les plus beaux,    Et j’en sais d’immortels qui sont de purs sanglots.
230To make of poetry a spontaneous overflow of powerful emotion, usuallyof sorrowful emotion, is what the French understand by lyricism (lelyrisme); and it may be objected that it is not fair to compare anepic poet like Homer with a lyricist like Musset.
Let us then take forour comparison the poet whom the ancients themselves looked upon asthe supreme type of the lyricist--Pindar.
He is superbly imaginative,“sailing,” as Gray tells us, “with supreme dominion through the azuredeep of air,” but his imagination is not like that of Musset in theservice of sensibility.
He does not bestow his own emotions upon usbut is rather in the Aristotelian sense an imitator.
He is indeed atthe very opposite pole from Rousseau and the “apostles of affliction.
Let a man,” he says, “not darken delight in his life.
Disclose notto strangers our burden of care; this at least shall I advise thee.
Therefore is it fitting to show openly to all the folk the fair andpleasant things allotted us; but if any baneful misfortune sent ofheaven befalleth man, it is seemly to shroud this in darkness.
231And one should also note Pindar’s hostility towards that other greatsource of romantic lyricism--nostalgia (“The desire of the moth forthe star”), and the closely allied pursuit of the strange and theexotic.
He tells of the condign punishment visited by Apollo upon thegirl Coronis who became enamoured of “a strange man from Arcadia,” andadds: “She was in love with things remote--that passion which many erenow have felt.
For among men, there is a foolish company of those who,putting shame on what they have at home, cast their glances afar, andpursue idle dreams in hopes that shall not be fulfilled.
232We are not to suppose that Pindar was that most tiresome andsuperficial of all types--the professional optimist who insists oninflicting his “gladness” upon us.
The immortals,” he says, “apportionto man two sorrows for every boon they grant.
233 In general theGreek whom Kipling sings and whom we already find in Schiller--theGreek who is an incarnation of the “joy of life unquestioned, theeverlasting wondersong of youth”234--is a romantic myth.
We readin the Iliad:235 “Of all the creatures that breathe or crawl uponthe earth, none is more wretched than man.
Here is the “joy of lifeunquestioned” in Homer.
Like Homer the best of the later Greeksand Romans face unflinchingly the facts of life and these facts donot encourage a thoughtless elation.
Their melancholy is even moreconcerned with the lot of man in general than with their personal andprivate grief.
The quality of this melancholy is rendered in Tennyson’sline on Virgil, one of the finest in nineteenth century English poetry:    Thou majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind.
236One should indeed not fail to distinguish between the note ofmelancholy in a Homer or a Virgil and the melancholy of the ancients,whether Stoic or Epicurean, who had experienced the hopelessness andhelplessness of a pure naturalism in dealing with ultimate problems.
The melancholy of the Stoic is the melancholy of the man who associateswith the natural order a “virtue” that the natural order does not give,and so is tempted to exclaim at last with Brutus, that he had thoughtvirtue a thing and had found that it was only a word.
The melancholy ofthe Epicurean is that of the man who has tasted the bitter sediment(amari aliquid) in the cup of pleasure.
It is not difficult todiscover modern equivalents of both Stoic and Epicurean melancholy.
One should seek,” says Sainte-Beuve, “in the pleasures of René thesecret of his ennuis,” and so far as this is true Chateaubriand ison much the same level as some Roman voluptuary who suffered fromthe tædium vitæ in the time of Tiberius or Nero.
237 But thoughthe Roman decadent gave himself up to the pursuit of sensation andoften of violent and abnormal sensation he was less prone than aChateaubriand to associate this pursuit with the “infinite”; and so hewas less nostalgic and hyperæsthetic.
His Epicureanism was thereforeless poetical no doubt, but on the other hand he did not set up mereromantic restlessness as a sort of substitute for religion.
It wasprobably easier therefore for him to feel the divine discontent andso turn to real religion than it would have been if he had, like theRousseauist, complicated his Epicureanism with sham spirituality.
To say that the melancholy even of the decadent ancient is lessnostalgic is perhaps only another way of saying what I have said aboutthe melancholy of the ancients in general--that it is not so purelypersonal.
It derives less from his very private and personal illusionsand still less from his very private and personal disillusions.
Inits purely personal quality romantic melancholy is indeed inseparablefrom the whole conception of original genius.
The genius sets out notmerely to be unique but unique in feeling, and the sense uniqueness infeeling speedily passes over into that of uniqueness in suffering--onthe principle no doubt laid down by Horace Walpole that life, which isa comedy for those who think, is a tragedy for those who feel.
To bea beautiful soul, to preserve one’s native goodness of feeling amongmen who have been perverted by society, is to be the elect of natureand yet this election turns out as Rousseau tells us to be a “fatalgift of heaven.
It is only the disillusioned romanticist, however,who assumes this elegiac tone.
We need to consider what he means byhappiness while he still seeks for it in the actual world and not inthe pays des chimères.
Rousseau tells us that he based the senseof his own worth on the fineness of his powers of perception.
Whyshould nature have endowed him with such exquisite faculties238 ifhe was not to have a satisfaction commensurate with them, if he was“to die without having lived”? We have here the psychological originsof the right to happiness that the romanticists were to proclaim.
We spend on the passions,” says Joubert, “the stuff that has beengiven us for happiness.
The Rousseauist hopes to find his happinessin the passions themselves.
Romantic happiness does not involve anymoral effort and has been defined in its extreme forms as a “monstrousdream of passive enjoyment.
Flaubert has made a study of the right tohappiness thus understood in his “Madame Bovary.
Madame Bovary, whois very commonplace in other respects, feels exquisitely; and inasmuchas her husband had no such fineness the right to happiness meant forher, as it did for so many other “misunderstood” women, the rightto extra-marital adventure.
One should note the germs of melancholythat lurk in the quest of the superlative moment even if the quest isrelatively successful.
Suppose Saint-Preux had succeeded in compressinginto a single instant “the delights of a thousand centuries”; and sofar as outer circumstances are concerned had had to pay no penalty.
Thenearer the approach to a superhuman intensity of feeling the greater islikely to be the ensuing languor.
The ordinary round of life seems paleand insipid compared with the exquisite and fugitive moment.
One seemsto one’s self to have drained the cup of life at a draught and saveperhaps for impassioned recollection of the perfect moment to have noreason for continuing to live.
One’s heart is “empty and swollen”239and one is haunted by thoughts of suicide.
This sense of having exhausted life240 and the accompanyingtemptation to suicide that are such striking features of the maladyof the age are not necessarily associated with any outer enjoyment atall.
One may devour life in revery and then the melancholy arises fromthe disproportion between the dream and the fact.
The revery that thusconsumes life in advance is not necessarily erotic.
What may be termedthe cosmic revery of a Senancour or an Amiel241 has very much thesame effect.
The atony and aridity of which the sufferer from romantic melancholycomplains may have other sources besides the depression that followsupon the achieving of emotional intensity whether in revery or in fact;it may also be an incident in the warfare between head and heart thatassumes so many forms among the spiritual posterity of Jean-Jacques.
The Rousseauist seeks happiness in emotional spontaneity and thisspontaneity seems to be killed by the head which stands aloof anddissects and analyzes.
Perhaps the best picture of the emotionalistwho is thus incapacitated for a frank surrender to his own emotionsis the “Adolphe” of Benjamin Constant (a book largely reminiscent ofConstant’s actual affair with Madame de Staël).
Whether the victim of romantic melancholy feels or analyzes heis equally incapable of action.
He who faces resolutely the rudebuffetings of the world is gradually hardened against them.
Theromantic movement is filled with the groans of those who have evadedaction and at the same time become highly sensitive and highlyself-conscious.
The man who thrills more exquisitely to pleasure thananother will also thrill more exquisitely to pain; nay, pleasure itselfin its extreme is allied to pain;242 so that to be hyperæsthetic isnot an unmixed advantage especially if it be true, as Pindar says,that the Gods bestow two trials on a man for every boon.
Perhaps thedeepest bitterness is found, not in those who make a pageant of theirbleeding hearts, but in those who, like Leconte de Lisle243 andothers (les impassibles), disdain to make a show of themselves to themob, and so dissimulate their quivering sensibility under an appearanceof impassibility; or, like Stendhal, under a mask of irony that “isimperceptible to the vulgar.
Stendhal aims not at emotional intensity only, but also glorifies thelust for power.
He did as much as any one in his time to promote theideal of the superman.
Yet even if the superman has nerves of steel,as seems to have been the case with Stendhal’s favorite, Napoleon, andacts on the outer world with a force of which the man in search of asensation is quite incapable, he does not act upon himself, he remainsethically passive.
This ethical passivity is the trait common to allthose who incline to live purely on the naturalistic level--whetherthey sacrifice the human law and its demands for measure to the lustof knowledge or the lust of sensation or the lust of power.
The manwho neglects his ethical self and withdraws into his temperamental orprivate self, must almost necessarily have the sense of isolation,of remoteness from other men.
We return here to the psychology ofthe original genius to whom it was a tame and uninteresting thingto be simply human and who, disdaining to seem to others a being ofthe same clay as themselves, wished to be in their eyes either anangel or a demon--above all a demon.
244 René does not, as I havesaid,245 want even the woman who loves him to feel at one with him,but rather to be at once astonished and appalled.
He exercises uponthose who approach him a malign fascination; for he not only livesin misery himself as in his natural element, but communicates thismisery to those who approach him.
He is like one of those fair treesunder which one cannot sit without perishing.
Moreover René disavowsall responsibility for thus being a human Upas-tree.
Moral effort isunavailing, for it was all written in the book of fate.
The victim ofromantic melancholy is at times tender and elegiac, at other times hesets up as a heaven-defying Titan.
This latter pose became especiallycommon in France around 1830 when the influence of Byron had been addedto that of Chateaubriand.
Under the influence of these two writers awhole generation of youth became “things of dark imaginings,”246predestined to a blight that was at the same time the badge of theirsuperiority.
One wished like René to have an “immense, solitary andstormy soul,” and also, like a Byronic hero, to have a diabolical glintin the eye and a corpse-like complexion,247 and so seem the “blindand deaf agent of funereal mysteries.
248 “It was possible to believeeverything about René except the truth.
The person who delights inbeing as mysterious as this easily falls into mystification.
Byronhimself we are told was rather flattered by the rumor that he hadcommitted at least one murder.
Baudelaire, it has been said, displayedhis moral gangrene as a warrior might display honorable wounds.
Thisflaunting of his own perversity was part of the literary attitude hehad inherited from the “Satanic School.
When the romanticist is not posing as the victim of fate he posesas the victim of society.
Both ways of dodging moral responsibilityenter into the romantic legend of the poète maudit.
Nobody lovesa poet.
His own mother according to Baudelaire utters a maledictionupon him.
249 That is because the poet feels so exquisitely that heis at once odious and unintelligible to the ordinary human pachyderm.
Inasmuch as the philistine is not too sensitive to act he has a greatadvantage over the poet in the real world and often succeeds in drivinghim from it and indeed from life itself.
This inferiority in action isa proof of the poet’s ideality.
His gigantic wings,” as Baudelairesays, “keep him from walking.
He has, in Coleridgean phrase, fed on“honey dew and drunk the milk of paradise,”250 and so can scarcelybe expected to submit to a diet of plain prose.
It is hardly necessaryto say that great poets of the past have not been at war with theirpublic in this way.
The reason is that they were less taken up withthe uttering of their own uniqueness; they were, without ceasing to bethemselves, servants of the general sense.
Chatterton became for the romanticists a favorite type of the poètemaudit, and his suicide a symbol of the inevitable defeat of the“ideal” by the “real.
The first performance of Vigny’s Chatterton(1835) with its picture of the implacable hatred of the philistinefor the artist was received by the romantic youth of Paris withsomething akin to delirium.
As Gautier says in his well-known accountof this performance one could almost hear in the night the crack ofthe solitary pistols.
The ordinary man of letters, says Vigny inhis preface to this play, is sure of success, even the great writermay get a hearing, but the poet, a being who is on a far higherlevel than either, can look forward only to “perpetual martyrdom andimmolation.
He comes into the world to be a burden to others; hisnative sensibility is so intimate and profound that it “has plungedhim from childhood into involuntary ecstasies, interminable reveries,infinite inventions.
Imagination possesses him above all … it sweepshis faculties heavenward as irresistibly as the balloon carries upits car.
From that time forth he is more or less cut off from normalcontact with his fellow-men.
His sensibility has become too keen;what only grazes other men wounds him until he bleeds.
He is thrownback more and more upon himself and becomes a sort of living volcano,“consumed by secret ardors and inexplicable languors,” and incapableof self-guidance.
Such is the poet.
From his first appearance he isan outlaw.
Let all your tears and all your pity be for him.
If he isfinally forced to suicide not he but society is to blame.
He is likethe scorpion that cruel boys surround with live coals and that isfinally forced to turn his sting upon himself.
Society therefore owesit to itself to see that this exquisite being is properly pensioned andprotected by government, to the end that idealism may not perish fromthe earth.
M.
Thiers who was prime minister at that time is said tohave received a number of letters from young poets, the general tenorof which was: “A position or I’ll kill myself.
251A circumstance that should interest Americans is that Poe asinterpreted by Baudelaire came to hold for a later generation ofromanticists the place that Chatterton had held for the romanticistsof 1830.
Poe was actually murdered, says Baudelaire--and there is anelement of truth in the assertion along with much exaggeration--bythis great gas-lighted barbarity (i.
e.
America).
All his inner andspiritual life whether drunkard’s or poet’s, was one constant effort toescape from this antipathetic atmosphere “in which,” Baudelaire goes onto say, “the impious love of liberty has given birth to a new tyranny,the tyranny of the beasts, a zoöcracy”; and in this human zoo a beingwith such a superhuman fineness of sensibility as Poe was of course ata hopeless disadvantage.
In general our elation at Poe’s recognition inEurope should be tempered by the reflection that this recognition isusually taken as a point of departure for insulting America.
Poe isabout the only hyperæsthetic romanticist we have had, and he thereforefell in with the main European tendency that comes down from theeighteenth century.
Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, whom I have already citedas an extreme example of romantic idealism, was one of Poe’s avowedfollowers; but Villiers is also related by his æsthetic and “diabolic”Catholicism to Chateaubriand; and the religiosity of Chateaubrianditself derives from the religiosity of Rousseau.
Hitherto I have been studying for the most part only one main type ofmodern melancholy.
This type even in a Chateaubriand or a Byron andstill more in their innumerable followers may seem at once superficialand theatrical.
It often does not get beyond that Epicurean toying withsorrow, that luxury of grief, which was not unknown even to classicalantiquity.
252 The despair of Chateaubriand is frequently only adisguise of his love of literary glory, and Chesterton is inclined tosee in the Byronic gloom an incident of youth and high spirits.
253But this is not the whole story even in Byron and Chateaubriand.
Tofind what is both genuine and distinctive in romantic melancholy weneed to enlarge a little further on the underlying difference betweenthe classicist and the Rousseauist.
The Rousseauist, as indeed themodern man in general, is more preoccupied with his separate andprivate self than the classicist.
Modern melancholy has practicallyalways this touch of isolation not merely because of the pronenessof the “genius” to dwell on his own uniqueness, but also because ofthe undermining of the traditional communions by critical analysis.
The noblest form of the “malady of the age” is surely that whichsupervened upon the loss of religious faith.
This is what distinguishesthe sadness of an Arnold or a Senancour from that of a Gray.
The“Elegy” belongs to the modern movement by the humanitarian note, thesympathetic interest in the lowly, but in its melancholy it doesnot go much beyond the milder forms of classical meditation on theinevitable sadness of life--what one may term pensiveness.
Like theother productions of the so-called graveyard school, it bears a directrelation to Milton’s “Il Penseroso.
It is well to retain Gray’s owndistinction.
Mine is a white Melancholy, or rather Leucocholy for themost part,” he wrote to Richard West in 1742, “but there is anothersort, black indeed, which I have now and then felt.
Gray did notexperience the more poignant sadness, one may suspect, without someloss of the “trembling hope” that is the final note of the “Elegy.
Noforlornness is greater than that of the man who has known faith andthen lost it.
Renan writes of his own break with the Church:    The fish of Lake Baikal, we are told, have spent thousands    of years in becoming fresh-water fish after being salt-water    fish.
I had to go through my transition in a few weeks.
Like an    enchanted circle Catholicism embraces the whole of life with so    much strength that when one is deprived of it everything seems    insipid.
I was terribly lost.
The universe produced upon me    the impression of a cold and arid desert.
For the moment that    Christianity was not the truth, all the rest appeared to me    indifferent, frivolous, barely worthy of interest.
The collapse    of my life upon itself left in me a feeling of emptiness    like that which follows an attack of fever or an unhappy    love-affair.
254The forlornness at the loss of faith is curiously combined in many ofthe romanticists with the mood of revolt.
This type of romanticistheaps reproaches on a God in whose existence he no longer believes(as in Leconte de Lisle’s “Quaïn,” itself related to Byron’s “Cain”).
He shakes his fist at an empty heaven, or like Alfred de Vigny (inhis Jardin des Oliviers) assumes towards this emptiness an attitudeof proud disdain.
He is loath to give up this grandiose defiance ofdivinity if only because it helps to save him from subsiding intoplatitude.
A somewhat similar mood appears in the “Satanic” Catholicswho continue to cling to religion simply because it adds to the gustoof sinning.
255 A Barbey succeeded in combining the rôle of ByronicTitan with that of champion of the Church.
But in general the romanticPrometheus spurns the traditional forms of communion whether classicalor Christian.
He is so far as everything established is concernedenormously centrifugal, but he hopes to erect on the ruins of the pastthe new religion of human brotherhood.
Everything in this movement fromShaftesbury down hinges on the rôle that is thus assigned to sympathy:if it can really unite men who are at the same time indulging each tothe utmost his own “genius” or idiosyncrasy there is no reason why oneshould not accept romanticism as a philosophy of life.
But nowhere else perhaps is the clash more violent between the theoryand the fact.
No movement is so profuse in professions of brotherhoodand none is so filled with the aching sense of solitude.
Behold methen alone upon the earth,” is the sentence with which Rousseau beginshis last book;256 and he goes on to marvel that he, the “most lovingof men,” had been forced more and more into solitude.
I am in theworld as though in a strange planet upon which I have fallen from theone that I inhabited.
257 When no longer subordinated to somethinghigher than themselves both the head and the heart (in the romanticsense) not only tend to be opposed to one another, but also, each inits own way, to isolate.
Empedocles was used not only by Arnold but byother victims258 of romantic melancholy, as a symbol of intellectualisolation: by his indulgence in the “imperious lonely thinking power”Empedocles has broken the warm bonds of sympathy with his fellows:                            thou art    A living man no more, Empedocles!    Nothing but a devouring flame of thought,--    But a naked eternally restless mind!His leaping into Ætna typifies his attempt to escape from hisloneliness by a fiery union with nature herself.
According to religion one should seek to unite with a something thatis set above both man and nature, whether this something is calledGod as in Christianity or simply the Law as in various philosophiesof the Far East.
259 The most severe penalty visited on the man whotransgresses is that he tends to fall away from this union.
This isthe element of truth in the sentence of Diderot that Rousseau took asa personal affront: “Only the wicked man is alone.
Rousseau assertedin reply, anticipating Mark Twain,260 that “on the contrary onlythe good man is alone.
Now in a sense Rousseau is right.
Most menare bad,” as one of the seven sages of Greece remarked, and any onewho sets out to follow a very strenuous virtue is likely to have fewcompanions on the way.
Rousseau is also right in a sense when he saysthat the wicked man needs to live in society so that he may haveopportunity to practice his wickedness.
Yet Rousseau fails to face themain issue: solitude is above all a psychic thing.
A man may frequenthis fellows and suffer none the less acutely, like Poe’s “Man of theCrowd,” from a ghastly isolation.
And conversely one may be like theancient who said that he was never less alone than when he was alone.
Hawthorne, who was himself a victim of solitude, brooded a great dealon this whole problem, especially, as may be seen in the “ScarletLetter” and elsewhere, on the isolating effects of sin.
He perceivedthe relation of the problem to the whole trend of religious life inNew England.
The older Puritans had a sense of intimacy with God andcraved no other companionship.
With the weakening of their faith thelater Puritans lost the sense of a divine companionship, but retainedtheir aloofness from men.
Hawthorne’s own solution of the problemof solitude, so far as he offers any, is humanitarian.
Quicken yoursympathies.
Let the man who has taken as his motto Excelsior261be warned.
Nothing will console him on the bleak heights either ofknowledge or of power for the warm contact with the dwellers in thevalley.
Faust, who is a symbol of the solitude of knowledge, seeks toescape from his forlornness by recovering this warm contact.
That theinordinate quest of power also leads to solitude is beyond question.
Napoleon, the very type of the superman, must in the nature of the casehave been very solitary.
262 His admirer Nietzsche wrote one day: “Ihave forty-three years behind me and am as alone as if I were a child.
Carlyle, whose “hero” derives like the superman from the originalgenius263 of the eighteenth century, makes the following entry in hisdiary: “My isolation, my feeling of loneliness, unlimitedness (muchmeant by this) what tongue shall say? Alone, alone!”264It cannot be granted, however, that one may escape by love, as theRousseauist understands the word, from the loneliness that arises fromthe unlimited quest either of knowledge or power.
For Rousseauisticlove is also unlimited whether one understands by love either passionor a diffusive sympathy for mankind at large.
What solitudes are thesehuman bodies,” Musset exclaimed when fresh from his affair with GeorgeSand.
Wordsworth cultivated a love for the lowly that quite overflowedthe bounds of neo-classic selection.
It is a well-known fact that thelowly did not altogether reciprocate.
A desolate-minded man, ye kna,”said an old inn-keeper of the Lakes to Canon Rawnsley, “’Twas potry asdid it.
If Wordsworth writes so poignantly of solitude one may inferthat it is because he himself had experienced it.
265 Nor would it bedifficult to show that the very philanthropic Ruskin was at least assolitary as Carlyle with his tirades against philanthropy.
I have spoken of the isolating effects of sin, but sin is scarcely theright word to apply to most of the romanticists.
The solitude of whichso many of them complain does, however, imply a good deal of spiritualinertia.
Now to be spiritually inert, as I have said elsewhere, isto be temperamental, to indulge unduly the lust for knowledge orsensation or power without imposing on these lusts some centre orprinciple of control set above the ordinary self.
The man who wishesto fly off on the tangent of his own temperament and at the same timeenjoy communion on any except the purely material level is harboringincompatible desires.
For temperament is what separates.
A sense ofunlimitedness (“much meant by this” as Carlyle says) and of solitudeare simply the penalties visited upon the eccentric individualist.
Ifwe are to unite on the higher levels with other men we must look inanother direction than the expansive outward striving of temperament:we must in either the humanistic or religious sense undergo conversion.
We must pull back our temperaments with reference to the model thatwe are imitating, just as, in Aristotle’s phrase, one might pullback and straighten out a crooked stick.
266 Usually the brake ontemperament is supplied by the ethos, the convention of one’s age andcountry.
I have tried to show elsewhere that the whole programme ofthe eccentric individualist is to get rid of this convention, whateverit may be, without developing some new principle of control.
Theeccentric individualist argues that to accept control, to defer to somecentre as the classicist demands, is to cease to be himself.
But arerestrictions upon temperament so fatal to a man’s being himself? Thereply hinges upon the definition of the word self, inasmuch as man isa dual being.
If a man is to escape from his isolation he must, I havesaid, aim at some goal set above his ordinary self which is at thesame time his unique and separate self.
But because this goal is setabove his ordinary self, it is not therefore necessarily set above histotal personality.
The limitations that he imposes on his ordinaryself may be the necessary condition of his entering into possession ofhis ethical self, the self that he possesses in common with other men.
Aristotle says that if a man wishes to achieve happiness he must be atrue lover of himself.
It goes without saying that he means the ethicalself.
The author of a recent book on Ibsen says that Ibsen’s message tothe world is summed up in the line:    This above all,--to thine own self be true.
It is abundantly plain from the context, however, that Polonius is adecayed Aristotelian and not a precursor of Ibsen.
The self to whichAristotle would have a man be true is at the opposite pole from theself that Ibsen and the original geniuses are so eager to get uttered.
To impose the yoke of one’s human self upon one’s temperamentalself is, in the Aristotelian sense, to work.
Aristotle conceives ofhappiness in terms of work.
All types of temperamentalists, on theother hand, are from the human point of view, passive.
The happinessthat they crave is a passive happiness.
A man may pursue power with theenergy of a Napoleon and yet remain ethically passive.
He may absorbwhole encyclopædias and remain ethically passive.
He may expand hissympathies until, like Schiller, he is ready to “bestow a kiss uponthe whole world” and yet remain ethically passive.
A man ceases tobe ethically passive only when he begins to work in the Aristoteliansense, that is when he begins to put the brake on temperament andimpulse, and in the same degree he tends to become ethically efficient.
By his denial of the dualism of the spirit, Rousseau discredited thisinner working, so that inwardness has come to seem synonymous with meresubjectivity; and to be subjective in the Rousseauistic sense is to bediffusive, to lack purpose and concentration, to lose one’s self in ashoreless sea of revery.
The utilitarian intervenes at this point and urges the romanticist,since he has failed to work inwardly, at least to work outwardly.
Having missed the happiness of ethical efficiency he may in this wayfind the happiness of material efficiency, and at the same time servethe world.
This is the solution of the problem of happiness that Goetheoffers at the end of the Second Faust, and we may affirm withouthesitation that it is a sham solution.
To work outwardly and in theutilitarian sense, without the inner working that can alone save fromethical anarchy is to stimulate rather than repress the most urgentof all the lusts--the lust of power.
It is only too plain that theunselective sympathy or joy in service with which Goethe would completeFaust’s utilitarian activity is not in itself a sufficient counterpoiseto the will to power, unless indeed we assume with Rousseau that onemay control expansive impulses by opposing them to one another.
A terrible danger thus lurks in the whole modern programme: it is aprogramme that makes for a formidable mechanical efficiency and sotends to bring into an ever closer material contact men who remainethically centrifugal.
The reason why the humanitarian and otherschemes of communion that have been set up during the last centuryhave failed is that they do not, like the traditional schemes, setany bounds to mere expansiveness, or, if one prefers, they do notinvolve any conversion.
And so it is not surprising that the feelingof emptiness267 or unlimitedness and isolation should be the specialmark of the melancholy of this period.
René complains of his “moralsolitude”;268 but strictly speaking his solitude is the reverse ofmoral.
Only by cultivating his human self and by the unceasing effortthat this cultivation involves does a man escape from his nightmare ofseparateness and so move in some measure towards happiness.
But thehappiness of which René dreams is unethical--something very private andpersonal and egoistic.
Nothing is easier than to draw the line fromRené to Baudelaire and later decadents--for instance to Des Esseintes,the hero of Huysmans’s novel “A Rebours,”269 who is typical of thelast exaggerations of the movement.
Des Esseintes cuts himself off ascompletely as possible from other men and in the artificial paradisehe has devised gives himself up to the quest of strange and violentsensation; but his dream of happiness along egoistic lines turns intoa nightmare,270 his palace of art becomes a hell.
Lemaître is quitejustified in saying of Des Esseintes that he is only René or Wertherbrought up to date--“a played-out and broken-down Werther who hasa malady of the nerves, a deranged stomach and eighty years more ofliterature to the bad.
271Emotional romanticism was headed from the start towards this bankruptcybecause of its substitution for ethical effort of a mere lazy floatingon the stream of mood and temperament.
I have said that Buddhismsaw in this ethical indolence the root of all evil.
Christianity inits great days was preoccupied with the same problem.
To make thispoint clear it will be necessary to add to what I have said aboutclassical and romantic melancholy a few words about melancholy in theMiddle Ages.
In a celebrated chapter of his “Genius of Christianity”(Le Vague des passions) Chateaubriand seeks to give to the maladyof the age Christian and mediæval origins.
This was his pretext,indeed, for introducing René into an apology for Christianity and so,as Sainte-Beuve complained, administering poison in a sacred wafer.
Chateaubriand begins by saying that the modern man is melancholybecause, without having had experience himself, he is at the sametime overwhelmed by the second-hand experience that has been heapedup in the books and other records of an advanced civilization; and sohe suffers from a precocious disillusion; he has the sense of havingexhausted life before he has enjoyed it.
There is nothing specificallyChristian in this disillusion and above all nothing mediæval.
ButChateaubriand goes on to say that from the decay of the pagan worldand the barbarian invasions the human spirit received an impressionof sadness and possibly a tinge of misanthropy which has never beencompletely effaced.
Those that were thus wounded and estranged fromtheir fellow-men took refuge formerly in monasteries, but now thatthis resource has failed them, they are left in the world without beingof it and so they “become the prey of a thousand chimeras.
Then isseen the rise of that guilty melancholy which the passions engenderwhen, left without definite object, they prey upon themselves in asolitary heart.
272The vague des passions, the expansion of infinite indeterminatedesire, that Chateaubriand here describes may very well be related tocertain sides of Christianity--especially to what may be termed itsneo-Platonic side.
Yet Christianity at its best has shown itself agenuine religion, in other words, it has dealt sternly and veraciouslywith the facts of human nature.
It has perceived clearly how a man maymove towards happiness and how on the other hand he tends to sink intodespair; or what amounts to the same thing, it has seen the supremeimportance of spiritual effort and the supreme danger of spiritualsloth.
The man who looked on himself as cut off from God and so ceasedto strive was according to the mediæval Christian the victim ofacedia.
This sluggishness and slackness of spirit, this mere driftingand abdication of will, may, as Chaucer’s parson suggests, be the crimeagainst the Holy Ghost itself.
It would in fact not be hard to showthat what was taken by the Rousseauist to be the badge of spiritualdistinction was held by the mediæval Christian to be the chief of allthe deadly sins.
The victim of acedia often looked upon himself, like the victim ofthe malady of the age, as foredoomed.
But though the idea of fateenters at times into mediæval melancholy, the man of the Middle Agescould scarcely so detach himself from the community as to sufferfrom that sense of loneliness which is the main symptom of romanticmelancholy.
This forlornness was due not merely to the abruptdisappearance of the older forms of communion, but to the failure ofthe new attempts at communion.
When one gets beneath the surface ofthe nineteenth century one finds that it was above all a period ofviolent disillusions, and it is especially after violent disillusionthat a man feels himself solitary and forlorn.
I have said that thespecial mark of the half-educated man is his harboring of incompatibledesires.
The new religions or unifications of life that appearedduring the nineteenth century made an especially strong appeal to thehalf-educated man because it seemed to him that by accepting some oneof these he could enjoy the benefits of communion and at the same timenot have to take on the yoke of any serious discipline; that he could,in the language of religion, achieve salvation without conversion.
Whena communion on these lines turns out to be not a reality, but a sham,and its disillusioned votary feels solitary and forlorn, he is ready toblame everybody and everything except himself.
A few specific illustrations will help us to understand how romanticsolitude, which was created by the weakening of the traditionalcommunions, was enhanced by the collapse of various sham communions.
Let us return for a moment to that eminent example of romanticmelancholy and disillusion, Alfred de Vigny.
His “Chatterton” dealswith the fatal misunderstanding of the original genius by other men.
Moïse” deals more specifically with the problem of his solitude.
Thegenius is so eminent and unique, says Vigny, speaking for himself frombehind the mask of the Hebrew prophet, that he is quite cut off fromordinary folk who feel that they have nothing in common with him.
273This forlornness of the genius is not the sign of some capital error inhis philosophy.
On the contrary it is the sign of his divine election,and so Moses blames God for his failure to find happiness.
274 Ifthe genius is cut off from communion with men he cannot hope forcompanionship with God because he has grown too sceptical.
Heaven isempty and in any case dumb; and so in the poem to which I have alreadyreferred (Le Mont des Oliviers) Vigny assumes the mask of Jesushimself to express this desolateness, and concludes that the just manwill oppose a haughty and Stoic disdain to the divine silence.
275All that is left for the genius is to retire into his ivory tower--aphrase appropriately applied for the first time to Vigny.
276 In theivory tower he can at least commune with nature and the ideal woman.
But Vigny came at a time when the Arcadian glamour was being dissipatedfrom nature.
Partly under scientific influence she was coming to seemnot a benign but a cold and impassive power, a collection of crueland inexorable laws.
I have already mentioned this mood that mightbe further illustrated from Taine and so many others towards themiddle of the nineteenth century.
277 “I am called a ‘mother,’” Vignymakes Nature say, “and I am a tomb.
278 (“La Maison du Berger”);and so in the Maison roulante, or sort of Arcadia on wheels that hehas imagined, he must seek his chief solace with the ideal femininecompanion.
But woman herself turns out to be treacherous; and, assumingthe mask of Samson (“La Colère de Samson”), Vigny utters a solemnmalediction upon the eternal Delilah (Et, plus ou moins, la Femmeest toujours Dalila).
Such is the disillusion that comes from havingsought an ideal communion in a liaison with a Parisian actress.
279Now that every form of communion has failed, all that is left itwould seem is to die in silence and solitude like the wolf (“La Mortdu Loup”).
Vigny continues to hold, however, like the author of the“City of Dreadful Night,” that though men may not meet in their joys,they may commune after a fashion in their woe.
He opposes to heartlessnature and her “vain splendors” the religion of pity, “the majesty ofhuman sufferings.
280 Towards the end when Vigny feels the growingprestige of science, he holds out the hope that a man may to a certainextent escape from the solitude of his own ego into some larger wholeby contributing his mite to “progress.
But the symbol of thiscommunion281 that he has chosen--that of the shipwrecked and sinkingmariner who consigns his geographical discoveries to a bottle in thehope that it may be washed up on some civilized shore--is itself of asingular forlornness.
Vigny has a concentration and power of philosophical reflection thatis rare among the romanticists.
George Sand is inferior to him inthis respect but she had a richer and more generous nature, and isperhaps even more instructive in her life and writings for the studentof romantic melancholy.
After the loss of the religious faith of herchildhood she became an avowed Rousseauist.
She attacks a societythat seems to her to stand in the way of the happiness of which shedreams--the supreme emotional intensity to be achieved in an ideallove.
In celebrating passion and the rights of passion she is lyricalin the two main modes of the Rousseauist--she is either tender andelegiac, or else stormy and Titanic.
But when she attempts to practicewith Musset this religion of love, the result is violent disillusion.
In the forlornness that follows upon the collapse of her sham communionshe meditates suicide.
Ten years ago,” she wrote in 1845 to Mazzini,“I was in Switzerland; I was still in the age of tempests; I made upmy mind even then to meet you, if I should resist the temptation tosuicide which pursued me upon the glaciers.
And then gradually a newfaith dawned upon her; she substituted for the religion of love thereligion of human brotherhood.
She set up as an object of worshiphumanity in its future progress; and then, like so many other dreamers,she suffered a violent disillusion in the Revolution of 1848.
Theradiant abstraction she had been worshipping had been put to the testand she discovered that there entered into the actual make-up of thehumanity she had so idealized “a large number of knaves, a very largenumber of lunatics, and an immense number of fools.
What is noteworthyin George Sand is that she not only saved the precious principle offaith from these repeated shipwrecks but towards the end of her lifebegan to put it on a firmer footing.
Like Goethe she worked out to someextent, in opposition to romanticism, a genuinely ethical point of view.
This latter development can best be studied in her correspondence withFlaubert.
She urges him to exercise his will, and he replies that heis as “fatalistic as a Turk.
His fatalism, however, was not orientalbut scientific or pseudo-scientific.
I have already cited his demandthat man be studied “objectively” just as one would study “a mastodonor a crocodile.
Flaubert refused to see any connection between thisdeterminism and his own gloom or between George Sand’s assertionof will and her cheerfulness.
It was simply, he held, a matter oftemperament, and there is no doubt some truth in this contention.
You at the first leap mount to heaven,” he says, “while I, poordevil, am glued to the earth as though by leaden soles.
And again:“In spite of your great sphinx eyes you have always seen the world asthrough a golden mist,” whereas “I am constantly dissecting; and whenI have finally discovered the corruption in anything that is supposedto be pure, the gangrene in its fairest parts, then I raise my headand laugh.
Yet George Sand’s cheerfulness is also related to herperception of a power in man to work upon himself--a power that setshim apart from other animals.
To enter into this region of ethicaleffort is to escape from the whole fatal circle of naturalism, and atthe same time to show some capacity to mature--a rare achievement amongthe romanticists.
The contrast is striking here between George Sandand Hugo, who, as the ripe fruit of his meditations, yields nothingbetter than the apotheosis of Robespierre and Marat.
I wish to seeman as he is,” she writes to Flaubert.
He is not good or bad: he isgood and bad.
But he is something else besides: being good and bad hehas an inner force which leads him to be very bad and a little good,or very good and a little bad.
I have often wondered,” she adds, “whyyour ‘Education Sentimentale’ was so ill received by the public, andthe reason, as it seems to me, is that its characters are passive--thatthey do not act upon themselves.
But the Titaness of the period of“Lélia” can scarcely be said to have acted upon herself, so that she isjustified in writing: “I cannot forget that my personal victory overdespair is the work of my will, and of a new way of understanding lifewhich is the exact opposite of the one I held formerly.
How differentis the weary cry of Flaubert: “I am like a piece of clock work, whatI am doing to-day I shall be doing to-morrow; I did exactly the samething yesterday; I was exactly the same man ten years ago.
The correspondence of Flaubert and George Sand bears interestingly onanother of the sham religions of the nineteenth century--the religionof art.
Art is for Flaubert not merely a religion but a fanaticism.
Hepreaches abstinence, renunciation and mortification of the flesh in thename of art.
He excommunicates those who depart from artistic orthodoxyand speaks of heretics and disbelievers in art with a ferocity worthyof a Spanish inquisitor.
Ethical beauty such as one finds in theGreeks at their best resides in order and proportion; it is not a thingapart but the outcome of some harmonious whole.
Beauty in the purelyæsthetic and unethical sense that Flaubert gives to the word is littlemore than the pursuit of illusion.
The man who thus treats beauty asa thing apart, who does not refer back his quest of the exquisite tosome ethical centre will spend his life Ixion-like embracing phantoms.
O Art, Art,” exclaims Flaubert, “bitter deception, nameless phantom,which gleams and lures us to our ruin!” He speaks elsewhere of “thechimera of style which is wearing him out soul and body.
Attaching ashe did an almost religious importance to his quest of the exquisitehe became like so many other Rousseauists not merely æsthetic buthyperæsthetic.
He complains in his old age: “My sensibility is sharperthan a razor’s edge; the creaking of a door, the face of a bourgeois,an absurd statement set my heart to throbbing and completely upset me.
Hardly anywhere else, indeed, will one find such accents of bitterness,such melancholy welling up unbidden from the very depths of the heart,as in the devotees of art for art’s sake--Flaubert, Leconte de Lisle,Théophile Gautier.
George Sand takes Flaubert to task with admirable tact for his failureto subordinate art to something higher than itself.
Talent imposesduties; and art for art’s sake is an empty word.
As she grew older shesays she came more and more to put truth above beauty, and goodnessbefore strength.
I have reflected a great deal on what is true,and in this search for truth, the sentiment of my ego has graduallydisappeared.
The truth on which she had reflected was what she herselfcalls total truth (le vrai total), not merely truth according tothe natural law, which received such exclusive emphasis towards themiddle of the nineteenth century as to lead to the rise of anothersham religion--the religion of science.
You have a better sense fortotal truth,” she tells one of her correspondents “than Sainte-Beuve,Renan and Littré.
They have fallen into the German rut: therein liestheir weakness.
And Flaubert writes to George Sand: “What amazes anddelights me is the strength of your whole personality, not that of thebrain alone.
Furthermore the holding of the human law that made possible thisrounded development, this growth towards total truth, was a matter notof tradition but of immediate perception.
George Sand had succeeded,as Taine says, in making the difficult transition from an hereditaryfaith to a personal conviction.
Now this perception of the human law issomething very different from the pantheistic revery in which GeorgeSand was also an adept.
To look on revery as the equivalent of visionin the Aristotelian sense, as Rousseau and so many of his followershave done, is to fall into sham spirituality.
Maurice de Guérin fallsinto sham spirituality when he exclaims “Oh! this contact of natureand the soul would engender an ineffable voluptuousness, a prodigiouslove of heaven and of God.
I am not asserting that George Sand herselfdiscriminated sharply between ethical and æsthetic perception or thatshe is to be rated as a very great sage at any time.
Yet she owes herrecovery of serenity after suffering shock upon shock of disillusion toher having exercised in some degree what she terms “the contemplativesense wherein resides invincible faith” (le sens contemplatif oùréside la foi invincible), and the passages that bear witness to heruse of this well-nigh obsolete sense are found in her correspondence.
Wordsworth lauds in true Rousseauistic fashion a “wise passiveness.
But to be truly contemplative is not to be passive at all, but to be“energetic” in Aristotle’s sense, or strenuous in Buddha’s sense.
Itis a matter of no small import that the master analyst of the East andthe master analyst of the West are at one in their solution of thesupreme problem of ethics--the problem of happiness.
For there canbe no doubt that the energy282 in which the doctrine of Aristotleculminates is the same as the “strenuousness”283 on which Buddha putshis final emphasis.
The highest good they both agree is a contemplativeworking.
It is by thus working according to the human law that onerises above the naturalistic level.
The scientific rationalists ofthe nineteenth century left no place for this true human spontaneitywhen they sought to subject man entirely to the “law for thing.
Thisscientific determinism was responsible for a great deal of spiritualdepression and acedia, especially in France during the second halfof the nineteenth century.
284 But even if science is less dogmaticand absolute one needs to consider why it does not deserve to be giventhe supreme and central place in life, why it cannot in short take theplace of humanism and religion, and the working according to the humanlaw that they both enjoin.
A man may indeed effect through science a certain escape from himself,and this is very salutary so far as it goes; he has to disciplinehimself to an order that is quite independent of his own fancies andemotions.
He becomes objective in short, but objective according tothe natural and not according to the human law.
Objectivity of thiskind gives control over natural forces but it does not supply thepurpose for which these forces are to be used.
It gives the airship,for instance, but does not determine whether the airship is to go onsome beneficent errand or is to scatter bombs on women and children.
Science does not even set right limits to the faculty that it chieflyexercises--the intellect.
In itself it stimulates rather than curbs oneof the three main lusts to which human nature is subject--the lust ofknowledge.
Renan, who makes a religion of science, speaks of “sacredcuriosity.
But this is even more dangerous than the opposite excessof the ascetic Christian who denounces all curiosity as vain.
The manof science avers indeed that he does subordinate his knowledge to anadequate aim, namely the progress of humanity.
But the humanity of theBaconian is only an intellectual abstraction just as the humanity ofthe Rousseauist is only an emotional dream.
George Sand found, as wehave seen, that the passage from one’s dream of humanity to humanityin the concrete involved a certain disillusion.
The scientific orrationalistic humanitarian is subject to similar disillusions.
285Science not only fails to set proper limits to the activity of theintellect, but one must also note a curious paradox in its relationto the second of the main lusts to which man is subject, the lustfor emotion (libido sentiendi).
The prime virtue of science is tobe unemotional and at the same time keenly analytical.
Now protractedand unemotional analysis finally creates a desire, as Renan says, forthe opposite pole, “the kisses of the naïve being,” and in generalfor a frank surrender to the emotions.
Science thus actually preparesclients for the Rousseauist.
286 The man of science is also flatteredby the Rousseauistic notion that conscience and virtue are themselvesonly forms of emotion.
He is thus saved from anything so distasteful ashaving to subordinate his own scientific discipline to some superiorreligious or humanistic discipline.
He often oscillates between therationalistic and the emotional pole not only in other things but alsoin his cult of humanity.
But if conscience is merely an emotion thereis a cult that makes a more potent appeal to conscience than the cultof humanity itself and that is the cult of country.
One is here at theroot of the most dangerous of all the sham religions of the modernage--the religion of country, the frenzied nationalism that is nowthreatening to make an end of civilization itself.
Both emotional nationalism and emotional internationalism goback to Rousseau, but in his final emphasis he is an emotionalnationalist;287 and that is because he saw that patriotic “virtue” isa more potent intoxicant than the love of humanity.
The demonstrationcame in the French Revolution which began as a great internationalmovement on emotional lines and ended in imperialism and NapoleonBonaparte.
It is here that the terrible peril of a science that ispursued as an end in itself becomes manifest.
It disciplines man andmakes him efficient on the naturalistic level, but leaves him ethicallyundisciplined.
Now in the absence of ethical discipline the lustfor knowledge and the lust for feeling count very little, at leastpractically, compared with the third main lust of human nature--thelust for power.
Hence the emergence of that most sinister of all types,the efficient megalomaniac.
The final use of a science that has thusbecome a tool of the lust for power is in Burke’s phrase to “improvethe mystery of murder.
This union of material efficiency and ethical unrestraint, thoughin a way the upshot of the whole movement we have been studying, isespecially marked in the modern German.
Goethe as I have pointedout is ready to pardon Faust for grave violations of the moral lawbecause of work which, so far from being ethical, is, in view of theruin in which it involves the rustic pair, Baucis and Philemon, undersuspicion of being positively unethical.
Yet Goethe was far from beinga pure utilitarian and he had reacted more than most Germans of histime from Rousseauism.
Rousseau is glorified by Germans as a chiefsource of their Kultur, as I have already pointed out.
Now Kulturwhen analyzed breaks up into two very different things--scientificefficiency and emotionalism or what the Germans (and unfortunately notthe Germans alone) term “idealism.
There is no question about therelation of this idealism to the stream of tendency of which Rousseauis the chief representative.
By his corruption of conscience Rousseaumade it possible to identify character with temperament.
It was easyfor Fichte and others to take the next step and identify nationalcharacter with national temperament.
The Germans according to Fichteare all beautiful souls, the elect of nature.
If they have no specialword for character it is because to be a German and have character aresynonymous.
Character is something that gushes up from the primordialdepths of the German’s being without any conscious effort on hispart.
288 The members of a whole national group may thus flatter oneanother and inbreed their national “genius” in the romantic sense, andfeel all the while that they are ecstatic “idealists”; yet as a resultof the failure to refer their genius back to some ethical centre, towork, in other words, according to the human law, they may, so far asthe members of other national groups are concerned, remain in a stateof moral solitude.
Everything thus hinges on the meaning of the word work.
In the abstractand metaphysical sense man can know nothing of unity.
He may, however,by working in the human sense, by imposing, that is, due limits on hisexpansive desires, close up in some measure the gap in his own nature(the “civil war in the cave”) and so tend to become inwardly one.
Hemay hope in the same way to escape from the solitude of his own ego,for the inner unity that he achieves through work is only an enteringinto possession of his ethical self, the self that he possesses incommon with other men.
Thus to work ethically is not only to becomemore unified and happy but also to move away from what is lesspermanent towards what is more permanent and therefore more peacefulin his total nature; so that the problem of happiness and the problemof peace turn out at last to be inseparable.
Souls, says Emerson, never meet; and it is true that a man never quiteescapes from his solitude.
That does not make the choice of directionany the less important.
An infinite beckons to him on either hand.
Theone inspires the divine discontent, the other romantic restlessness.
If instead of following the romantic lure he heeds the call from theopposite direction, he will not indeed attain to any perfect communionbut he will be less solitary.
Strictly speaking a man is never happy inthe sense of being completely satisfied with the passing moment,289or never, Dr.
Johnson would add, except when he is drunk.
The happinessof the sober and waking man resides, it may be, not in his content withthe present moment but in the very effort that marks his passage from alower to a higher ethical level.
The happiness of which Rousseau dreamed, it has been made plain, wasnot this active and ethical happiness, but rather the passive enjoymentof the beautiful moment--the moment that he would like to have lastforever.
After seeking for the beautiful moment in the intoxication oflove, he turned as we have seen to pantheistic revery.
As long as itlasts,” he says of a moment of this kind, “one is self-sufficing likeGod.
Yes, but it does not last, and when he wakes from his dream ofcommunion with nature, he is still solitary, still the prisoner ofhis ego.
The pantheistic dreamer is passive in every sense.
He is notworking either according to the human or according to the natural law,and so is not gaining either in material or in ethical efficiency.
In a world such as that in which we live this seems too much likepicnicking on a battlefield.
Rousseau could on occasion speak shrewdlyon this point.
He wrote to a youthful enthusiast who wished to comeand live with him at Montmorency: “The first bit of advice I shouldlike to give you is not to indulge in the taste you say you have forthe contemplative life and which is only an indolence of the spiritreprehensible at every age and especially at yours.
Man is not made tomeditate but to act.
The contemplative life is then, according to Rousseau, the oppositeof action.
But to contemplate is according to an Aristotle or aBuddha to engage in the most important form of action, the form thatleads to happiness.
To identify leisure and the contemplative lifewith pantheistic revery, as Rousseau does, is to fall into one ofthe most vicious of confusions.
Perhaps indeed the most importantcontrast one can reach in a subject of this kind is that between awise strenuousness and a more or less wise passiveness, between thespiritual athlete and the cosmic loafer, between a Saint Paul, let ussay, and a Walt Whitman.
The spiritual idling and drifting of the Rousseauist would be lesssinister if it did not coexist in the world of to-day with an intensematerial activity.
The man who seeks happiness by work according to thenatural law is to be rated higher than the man who seeks happiness insome form of emotional intoxication (including pantheistic revery).
He is not left unarmed, a helpless dreamer in the battle of life.
Thetype of efficiency he is acquiring also helps him to keep at bay man’sgreat enemy, ennui.
An Edison, we may suppose, who is drawn ever onwardby the lure of wonder and curiosity and power, has little time to bebored.
It is surely better to escape from the boredom of life after thefashion of Edison than after the fashion of Baudelaire.
290I have already pointed out, however, the peril in a one-sided workingof this kind.
It makes man efficient without making him ethical.
Itstimulates rather than corrects a fearless, formless expansion on thehuman level.
This inordinate reaching out beyond bounds is, as thegreat Greek poets saw with such clearness, an invitation to Nemesis.
The misery that results from unrestraint, from failure to workaccording to the human law, is something different from mere pain andfar more to be dreaded; just as the happiness that results from a rightworking according to the human law is something different from merepleasure and far more worthy of pursuit.
The present alliance between emotional romanticists andutilitarians291 is a veritable menace to civilization itself.
Itdoes not follow, as I said in a previous chapter, because revery or“intuition of the creative flux” cannot take the place of leisure ormeditation, that one must therefore condemn it utterly.
It may likeother forms of romanticism have a place on the recreative side oflife.
What finally counts is work according to either the human orthe natural law, but man cannot always be working.
He needs momentsof relief from tension and concentration and even, it should seem, ofsemi-oblivion of his conscious self.
As one of the ways of winning suchmoments of relaxation and partial forgetfulness much may be said forrevery.
In general one must grant the solace and rich source of poetrythat is found in communion with nature even though the final emphasisbe put on communion with man.
It is no small thing to be, as Arnoldsays Wordsworth was, a “priest of the wonder and bloom of the world.
One cannot however grant the Wordsworthian that to be a priest ofwonder is necessarily to be also a priest of wisdom.
Thus to promote tothe supreme and central place something that is legitimate in its owndegree, but secondary, is to risk starting a sham religion.
Those who have sought to set up a cult of love or beauty or science orhumanity or country are open to the same objections as the votariesof nature.
However important each of these things may be in its ownplace, it cannot properly be put in the supreme and central place forthe simple reason that it does not involve any adequate conversionor discipline of man’s ordinary self to some ethical centre.
I havetried to show that the sense of solitude or forlornness that is sostriking a feature of romantic melancholy arises not only from a lossof hold on the traditional centres, but also from the failure ofthese new attempts at communion to keep their promises.
The number ofdiscomfitures of this kind in the period that has elapsed since thelate eighteenth century, suggests that this period was even more thanmost periods an age of sophistry.
Every age has had its false teachers,but possibly no age ever had so many dubious moralists as this, anincomparable series of false prophets from Rousseau himself down toNietzsche and Tolstoy.
It remains to sum up in a closing chapter theresults of my whole inquiry and at the same time to discuss somewhatmore specifically the bearing of my whole point of view, especially theidea of work according to the human law, upon the present situation.
CHAPTER XTHE PRESENT OUTLOOKIt has been my endeavor throughout this book to show that classic andromantic art, though both at their best highly imaginative, differ inthe quality of the imagination.
I pointed out in my first chapter thatin his recoil from the intellectual romanticism of the Renaissanceand the mediæval romanticism of actual adventure the neo-classicistcame to rest his literary faith on “reason” (by which he meant eitherordinary good sense or abstract reasoning), and then opposed thisreason or judgment to imagination.
This supposed opposition betweenreason and imagination was accepted by the romantic rebels againstneo-classicism and has been an endless source of confusion to thepresent day.
Though both neo-classicists and romanticists achieved muchadmirable work, work which is likely to have a permanent appeal, itis surely no small matter that they both failed on the whole to dealadequately with the imagination and its rôle whether in literatureor life.
Thus Dryden attributes the immortality of the Æneid to itsbeing “a well-weighed judicious poem.
Whereas poems which are producedby the vigor of imagination only have a gloss upon them at the firstwhich time wears off, the works of judgment are like the diamond; themore they are polished, the more lustre they receive.
292 Read onand you will find that Dryden thus stresses judgment by way of protestagainst the Cavalier Marini and the imaginative unrestraint that heand other intellectual romanticists display.
Dryden thus obscures thefact that what gives the immortalizing touch to the Æneid is not merejudgment but imagination--a certain quality of imagination.
Even thereader who is to enter properly into the spirit of Virgil needs morethan judgment--he needs to possess in some measure the same qualityof imagination.
The romantic answer to the neo-classic distrust ofthe imagination was the apotheosis of the imagination, but withoutsufficient discrimination as to its quality, and this led only toooften to an anarchy of the imagination--an anarchy associated, as wehave seen, in the case of the Rousseauist, with emotion rather thanwith thought or action.
The modern world has thus tended to oscillate between extremes in itsattitude towards the imagination, so that we still have to turn toancient Greece for the best examples of works in which the imaginationis at once disciplined and supreme.
Aristotle, I pointed out, is doinglittle more than give an account of this Greek practice when he saysthat the poet ranks higher than the historian because he achieves amore general truth, but that he can achieve this more general truthonly by being a master of illusion.
Art in which the illusion is notdisciplined to the higher reality counts at best on the recreativeside of life.
Imagination,” says Poe, “feeling herself for onceunshackled, roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowyand unstable land.
293 To take seriously the creations of this typeof imagination is to be on the way towards madness.
Every madhouse,indeed, has inmates who are very imaginative in the fashion Poe heredescribes.
We must not confuse the concentric or ethical with theeccentric imagination if we are to define rightly the terms classicand romantic or indeed to attain to sound criticism at all.
My wholeaim has been to show that a main stream of emotional sophistry thattakes its rise in the eighteenth century and flows down through thenineteenth involves just such a confusion.
The general distinction between the two types of imagination would seemsufficiently clear.
To apply the distinction concretely is, it must beadmitted, a task infinitely difficult and delicate, a task that callsfor the utmost degree of the esprit de finesse.
In any particularcase there enters an element of vital novelty.
The relation of thisvital novelty to the ethical or permanent element in life is somethingthat cannot be determined by any process of abstract reasoning or byany rule of thumb; it is a matter of immediate perception.
The art ofthe critic is thus hedged about with peculiar difficulties.
It does notfollow that Aristotle himself because he has laid down sound principlesin his Poetics, would always have been right in applying them.
Ourevidence on this point is as a matter of fact somewhat scanty.
Having thus admitted the difficulty of the undertaking we may ourselvesattempt a few concrete illustrations of how sound critical standardstended to suffer in connection with the romantic movement.
Leavingaside for the moment certain larger aspects of the ethical imaginationthat I am going to discuss presently, let us confine ourselves topoetry.
Inasmuch as the ethical imagination does not in itself givepoetry but wisdom, various cases may evidently arise: a man may be wisewithout being poetical; he may be poetical without being wise; he maybe both wise and poetical.
We may take as an example of the person who was wise without beingpoetical Dr.
Johnson.
Though most persons would grant that Dr.
Johnsonwas not poetical, it is well to remember that this generalization hasonly the approximate truth that a literary generalization can have.
Thelines on Levet have been inserted and rightly in anthologies.
If not onthe whole poetical, Johnson was, as Boswell says, eminently fitted tobe a “majestic teacher of moral and religious wisdom.
Few men have hada firmer grasp on the moral law or been freer from the various forms ofsophistry that tend to obscure it.
Unlike Socrates, however, of whom hereminds us at times by his ethical realism, Johnson rests his insightnot on a positive but on a traditional basis.
To say that Johnsonwas truly religious is only another way of saying that he was trulyhumble, and one of the reasons for his humility was his perceptionof the ease with which illusion in man passes over into delusion,and even into madness.
His chapter on the “Dangerous Prevalence ofImagination” in “Rasselas” not only gives the key to that work but tomuch else in his writings.
What he opposes to this dangerous prevalenceof imagination is not a different type of imagination but the usualneo-classical reason or judgment or “sober probability.
His defenceof wisdom against the gathering naturalistic sophistries of his timeis therefore somewhat lacking in imaginative prestige.
He seemed tobe opposing innovation on purely formalistic and traditional groundsin an age which was more and more resolutely untraditional and whichwas determined above all to emancipate the imagination from itsstrait-jacket of formalism.
Keats would not have hesitated to rankJohnson among those who “blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face.
Keats himself may serve as a type of the new imaginative spontaneityand of the new fullness and freshness of sensuous perception.
IfJohnson is wise without being poetical, Keats is poetical without beingwise, and here again we need to remember that distinctions of thiskind are only approximately true.
Keats has written lines that havehigh seriousness.
He has written other lines which without being wiseseem to lay claim to wisdom--notably the lines in which, followingShaftesbury and other æsthetes, he identifies truth and beauty; anidentification that was disproved for practical purposes at least asfar back as the Trojan War.
Helen was beautiful, but was neither goodnor true.
In general, however, Keats’s poetry is not sophistical.
Itis simply delightfully recreative.
There are signs that Keats himselfwould not have been content in the long run with a purely recreativerôle--to be “the idle singer of an empty day.
Whether he would everhave achieved genuine ethical purpose is a question.
In working out awise view of life he did not, like Dante, have the support of a greatand generally accepted tradition.
It is not certain again that he wouldever have developed the critical keenness that enabled a Sophocles towork out a wise view of life in a less traditional age than that ofDante.
The evidence is rather that Keats would have succumbed, to hisown poetical detriment, to some of the forms of sham wisdom current inhis day, especially the new humanitarian evangel.
294In any case we may contrast Sophocles and Dante with Keats as examplesof poets who were not merely poetical but wise--wise in the relativeand imperfect sense in which it is vouchsafed to mortals to achievewisdom.
Sophocles and Dante are not perhaps more poetical thanKeats--it is not easy to be more poetical than Keats.
As Tennyson says,“there is something magic and of the innermost soul of poetry in almosteverything he wrote.
Yet Sophocles and Dante are not only superiorto Keats, but in virtue of the presence of the ethical imagination intheir work, superior not merely in degree but in kind.
Not that evenSophocles and Dante maintain themselves uniformly on the level ofthe ethical imagination.
There are passages in Dante which are lessimaginative than theological.
Passages of this kind are even morenumerous in Milton, a poet who on the whole is highly serious.
295 Itis in general easy to be didactic, hard to achieve ethical insight.
If Keats is highly imaginative and poetic without on the whole risingto high seriousness or sinking to sophistry, Shelley, on the otherhand, illustrates in his imaginative activity the confusion of valuesthat was so fostered by romanticism.
Here again I do not wish to be tooabsolute.
Shelley has passages especially in his “Adonais” that areon a high level.
Yet nothing is more certain than that the quality ofhis imagination is on the whole not ethical but Arcadian or pastoral.
In the name of his Arcadia conceived as the “ideal” he refuses toface the facts of life.
I have already spoken of the flimsiness of his“Prometheus Unbound” as a solution of the problem of evil.
What isfound in this play is the exact opposite of imaginative concentrationon the human law.
The imagination wanders irresponsibly in a regionquite outside of normal human experience.
We are hindered from enjoyingthe gorgeous iridescences of Shelley’s cloudland by Shelley’s ownevident conviction that it is not a cloudland, an “intense inane,” buta true empyrean of the spirit.
And our irritation at Shelley’s ownconfusion is further increased by the long train of his indiscreetadmirers.
Thus Professor C.
H.
Herford writes in the “Cambridge Historyof English Literature” that what Shelley has done in the “PrometheusUnbound,” is to give “magnificent expression to the faith of Plato andof Christ”!296 Such a statement in such a place is a veritable dangersignal, an indication of some grave spiritual bewilderment in thepresent age.
To show the inanity of these attempts to make a wise manof Shelley it is enough to compare him not with Plato and Christ, butwith the poet whom he set out at once to continue and contradict--withÆschylus.
The “Prometheus Bound” has the informing ethical imaginationthat the “Prometheus Unbound” lacks, and so in its total structurebelongs to an entirely different order of art.
Shelley, indeed, hasadmirable details.
The romanticism of nympholeptic longing may almostbe said to culminate, at least in England, in the passage I havealready cited (“My soul is an enchanted boat”).
There is no reason whyin recreative moods one should not imagine one’s soul an enchantedboat and float away in a musical rapture with the ideal dream companiontowards Arcady.
But to suppose that revery of this kind has anything todo with the faith of Plato and of Christ, is to fall from illusion intodangerous delusion.
We may doubt whether if Shelley had lived longer he would ever haverisen above emotional sophistry and become more ethical in the qualityof his imagination.
Such a progress from emotional sophistry to ethicalinsight we actually find in Goethe; and this is the last and mostcomplex case we have to consider.
Johnson, I have said, is wise withoutbeing poetical and Keats poetical without being wise; Sophocles isboth poetical and wise, whereas Shelley is poetical, but with a taintof sophistry or sham wisdom.
No such clear-cut generalization can beventured about Goethe.
I have already quoted Goethe’s own judgmenton his “Werther” as weakness seeking to give itself the prestige ofstrength, and perhaps it would be possible to instance from his earlywritings even worse examples of a morbid emotionalism (e.
g.
Stella”).
How about “Faust” itself? Most Germans will simply dismiss such aquestion as profane.
With Hermann Grimm they are ready to pronounce“Faust” the greatest work of the greatest poet of all times, and ofall peoples.
Yet it is not easy to overlook the sophistical elementin both parts of “Faust.
I have already commented on those passagesthat would seem especially sophistical: the passage in which the devilis defined as the spirit that always says no strikes at the very rootof any proper distinction between good and evil.
The passage again inwhich Faust breaks down all precise discrimination in favor of mereemotional intoxication is an extreme example of the Rousseauisticart of “making madness beautiful.
The very conclusion of the wholepoem, with its setting up of work according to the natural law as asubstitute for work according to the human law, is an egregious pieceof sham wisdom.
The result of work according to the human law, ofethical efficiency in short, is an increasing serenity; and it is notclear that Faust is much calmer at the end of the poem than he is atthe beginning.
According to Dr.
Santayana he is ready to carry intoheaven itself his romantic restlessness--his desperate and feverishattempts to escape from ennui.
297 Perhaps this is not the whole trutheven in regard to “Faust”; and still less can we follow Dr.
Santayanawhen he seems to discover in the whole work of Goethe only romanticrestlessness.
At the very time when Goethe was infecting others withthe wild expansiveness of the new movement, he himself was beginningto strike out along an entirely different path.
He writes in hisJournal as early as 1778: “A more definite feeling of limitation andin consequence of true broadening.
Goethe here glimpses the truththat lies at the base of both humanism and religion.
He saw that theromantic disease was the imaginative and emotional straining towardsthe unlimited (Hang zum Unbegrenzten), and in opposition to thisunrestraint he was never tired of preaching the need of working withinboundaries.
It may be objected that Goethe is in somewhat the samecase here as Rousseau: that the side of his work which has imaginativeand emotional driving power and has therefore moved the world is of anentirely different order.
We may reply that Goethe is at times bothpoetical and wise.
Furthermore in his maxims and conversations wherehe does not rise to the poetical level, he displays a higher quality ofwisdom than Rousseau.
At his best he shows an ethical realism worthyof Dr.
Johnson, though in his attitude towards tradition he is lessJohnsonian than Socratic.
Like Socrates he saw on what terms a breakwith the past may be safely attempted.
Anything that emancipates thespirit,” he says, “without a corresponding growth in self-mastery, ispernicious.
We may be sure that if the whole modern experiment failsit will be because of the neglect of the truth contained in this maxim.
Goethe also saw that a sound individualism must be rightly imaginative.
He has occasional hints on the rôle of illusion in literature and lifethat go far beneath the surface.
Though the mature Goethe, then, always stands for salvation by work,it is not strictly correct to say that it is work only accordingto the natural law.
In Goethe at his best the imagination acceptsthe limitations imposed not merely by the natural, but also by thehuman law.
However, we must admit that the humanistic Goethe has hadfew followers either in Germany or elsewhere, whereas innumerablepersons have escaped from the imaginative unrestraint of the emotionalromanticist, as Goethe himself likewise did, by the discipline ofscience.
The examples I have chosen should suffice to show how my distinctionbetween two main types of imagination--the ethical type that giveshigh seriousness to creative writing and the Arcadian or dallianttype that does not raise it above the recreative level--works out inpractice.
Some such distinction is necessary if we are to understandthe imagination in its relation to the human law.
But in order tograsp the present situation firmly we need also to consider theimagination in its relation to the natural law.
I have just said thatmost men have escaped from the imaginative anarchy of the emotionalromanticist through science.
Now the man of science at his best islike the humanist at his best, at once highly imaginative and highlycritical.
By this coöperation of imagination and intellect they areboth enabled to concentrate effectively on the facts, though on factsof a very different order.
The imagination reaches out and perceiveslikenesses and analogies whereas the power in man that separatesand discriminates and traces causes and effects tests in turn theselikenesses and analogies as to their reality: for we can scarcelyrepeat too often that though the imagination gives unity it does notgive reality.
If we were all Aristotles or even Goethes we mightconcentrate imaginatively on both laws, and so be both scientific andhumanistic: but as a matter of fact the ordinary man’s capacity forconcentration is limited.
After a spell of concentration on either lawhe aspires to what Aristotle calls “relief from tension.
Now the veryconditions of modern life require an almost tyrannical concentrationon the natural law.
The problems that have been engaging more and morethe attention of the Occident since the rise of the great Baconianmovement have been the problems of power and speed and utility.
Theenormous mass of machinery that has been accumulated in the pursuit ofthese ends requires the closest attention and concentration if it isto be worked efficiently.
At the same time the man of the West is notwilling to admit that he is growing in power alone, he likes to thinkthat he is growing also in wisdom.
Only by keeping this situation inmind can we hope to understand how emotional romanticism has beenable to develop into a vast system of sham spirituality.
I have saidthat the Rousseauist wants unity without reality.
If we are to movetowards reality, the imagination must be controlled by the powerof discrimination and the Rousseauist has repudiated this power as“false and secondary.
But a unity that lacks reality can scarcely beaccounted wise.
The Baconian, however, accepts this unity gladly.
Hehas spent so much energy in working according to the natural law thathe has no energy left for work according to the human law.
By turningto the Rousseauist he can get the “relief from tension” that he needsand at the same time enjoy the illusion of receiving a vast spiritualillumination.
Neither Rousseauist nor Baconian carry into the realmof the human law the keen analysis that is necessary to distinguishbetween genuine insight and some mere phantasmagoria of the emotions.
I am speaking especially, of course, of the interplay of Rousseauisticand Baconian elements that appear in certain recent philosophies likethat of Bergson.
According to Bergson one becomes spiritual by throwingoverboard both thought and action, and this is a very convenient notionof spirituality for those who wish to devote both thought and action toutilitarian and material ends.
It is hard to see in Bergson’s intuitionof the creative flux and perception of real duration anything morethan the latest form of Rousseau’s transcendental idling.
To work withsomething approaching frenzy according to the natural law and to beidle according to the human law must be accounted a rather one-sidedview of life.
The price the man of to-day has paid for his increasein power is, it should seem, an appalling superficiality in dealingwith the law of his own nature.
What brings together Baconian andRousseauist in spite of their surface differences is that they are bothintent on the element of novelty.
But if wonder is associated with theMany, wisdom is associated with the One.
Wisdom and wonder are movingnot in the same but in opposite directions.
The nineteenth century mayvery well prove to have been the most wonderful and the least wiseof centuries.
The men of this period--and I am speaking of course ofthe main drift--were so busy being wonderful that they had no time,apparently, to be wise.
Yet their extreme absorption in wonder and themanifoldness of things can scarcely be commended unless it can be shownthat happiness also results from all this revelling in the elementof change.
The Rousseauist is not quite consistent on this point.
Attimes he bids us boldly set our hearts on the transitory.
Aimez,says Vigny, ce que jamais on ne verra deux fois.
But the Rousseauiststrikes perhaps a deeper chord when looking forth on a world of flux heutters the anguished exclamation of Leconte de Lisle: Qu’est-ce quetout cela qui n’est pas éternel? Even as one swallow, says Aristotle,does not make a spring, so no short time is enough to determine whethera man deserves to be called happy.
The weakness of the romantic pursuitof novelty and wonder and in general of the philosophy of the beautifulmoment--whether the erotic moment298 or the moment of cosmicrevery--is that it does not reckon sufficiently with the somethingdeep down in the human breast that craves the abiding.
To pin one’shope of happiness to the fact that “the world is so full of a number ofthings” is an appropriate sentiment for a “Child’s Garden of Verse.
For the adult to maintain an exclusive Bergsonian interest in “theperpetual gushing forth of novelties” would seem to betray an inabilityto mature.
The effect on a mature observer of an age so entirely turnedfrom the One to the Many as that in which we are living must be that ofa prodigious peripheral richness joined to a great central void.
What leads the man of to-day to work with such energy according tothe natural law and to be idle according to the human law is hisintoxication with material success.
A consideration that shouldtherefore touch him is that in the long run not merely spiritualsuccess or happiness, but material prosperity depend on an entirelydifferent working.
Let me revert here for a moment to my previousanalysis: to work according to the human law is simply to rein in one’simpulses.
Now the strongest of all the impulses is the will to power.
The man who does not rein in his will to power and is at the same timevery active according to the natural law is in a fair way to becomean efficient megalomaniac.
Efficient megalomania, whether developedin individuals of the same group or in whole national groups in theirrelations with one another, must lead sooner or later to war.
Theefficient megalomaniacs will proceed to destroy one another along withthe material wealth to which they have sacrificed everything else; andthen the meek, if there are any meek left, will inherit the earth.
If I am to judge by myself,” said an eighteenth-century Frenchman,“man is a stupid animal.
Man is not only a stupid animal in spiteof his conceit of his own cleverness but we are here at the sourceof his stupidity.
The source is the moral indolence that Buddha withhis almost infallible sagacity defined long ago.
In spite of the factthat his spiritual and in the long run his material success hinge onhis ethical effort, man persists in dodging this effort, in seeking tofollow the line of least or lesser resistance.
An energetic materialworking does not mend but aggravate the failure to work ethically andis therefore especially stupid.
Just this combination has in fact ledto the crowning stupidity of the ages--the Great War.
No more deliriousspectacle has ever been witnessed than that of hundreds of millionsof human beings using a vast machinery of scientific efficiency toturn life into a hell for one another.
It is hard to avoid concludingthat we are living in a world that has gone wrong on first principles,a world that, in spite of all the warnings of the past, has alloweditself to be caught once more in the terrible naturalistic trap.
Thedissolution of civilization with which we are threatened is likely tobe worse in some respects than that of Greece or Rome in view of thesuccess that has been attained in “perfecting the mystery of murder.
Various traditional agencies are indeed still doing much to chainup the beast in man.
Of these the chief is no doubt the Church.
Butthe leadership of the Occident is no longer here.
The leaders havesuccumbed in greater or less degree to naturalism299 and so have beentampering with the moral law.
That the brutal imperialist who brooksno obstacle to his lust for dominion has been tampering with this lawgoes without saying; but the humanitarian, all adrip with brotherhoodand profoundly convinced of the loveliness of his own soul, has beentampering with it also, and in a more dangerous way for the veryreason that it is less obvious.
This tampering with the moral law, orwhat amounts to the same thing, this overriding of the veto power inman, has been largely a result, though not a necessary result, of therupture with the traditional forms of wisdom.
The Baconian naturalistrepudiated the past because he wished to be more positive and critical,to plant himself upon the facts.
Yet the veto power is itself afact,--the weightiest with which man has to reckon.
The Rousseauisticnaturalist threw off traditional control because he wished to be moreimaginative.
Yet without the veto power the imagination falls intosheer anarchy.
Both Baconian and Rousseauist were very impatient ofany outer authority that seemed to stand between them and their ownperceptions.
Yet the veto power is nothing abstract, nothing that oneneeds to take on hearsay, but is very immediate.
The naturalisticleaders may be proved wrong without going beyond their own principles,and their wrongness is of a kind to wreck civilization.
I have no quarrel, it is scarcely necessary to add, either with the manof science or the romanticist when they keep in their proper place.
As soon however as they try, whether separately or in unison, to setup some substitute for humanism or religion, they should be at onceattacked, the man of science for not being sufficiently positive andcritical, the romanticist for not being rightly imaginative.
This brings us back to the problem of the ethical imagination--theimagination that has accepted the veto power--which I promised amoment ago to treat in its larger aspects.
This problem is indeedin a peculiar sense the problem of civilization itself.
A curiouscircumstance should be noted here: a civilization that rests on dogmaand outer authority cannot afford to face the whole truth about theimagination and its rôle.
A civilization in which dogma and outerauthority have been undermined by the critical spirit, not only canbut must do this very thing if it is to continue at all.
Man, a beingever changing and living in a world of change, is, as I said at theoutset, cut off from immediate access to anything abiding and thereforeworthy to be called real, and condemned to live in an element offiction or illusion.
Yet civilization must rest on the recognitionof something abiding.
It follows that the truths on the survival ofwhich civilization depends cannot be conveyed to man directly butonly through imaginative symbols.
It seems hard, however, for man toanalyze critically this disability under which he labors, and, facingcourageously the results of his analysis, to submit his imaginationto the necessary control.
He consents to limit his expansive desiresonly when the truths that are symbolically true are presented to him asliterally true.
The salutary check upon his imagination is thus won atthe expense of the critical spirit.
The pure gold of faith needs, itshould seem, if it is to gain currency, to be alloyed with credulity.
But the civilization that results from humanistic or religious controltends to produce the critical spirit.
Sooner or later some Voltaireutters his fatal message:    Les prêtres ne sont pas ce qu’un vain peuple pense;    Nôtre crédulité fait toute leur science.
The emancipation from credulous belief leads to an anarchicindividualism that tends in turn to destroy civilization.
There is someevidence in the past that it is not quite necessary to run through thiscycle.
Buddha, for example, was very critical; he had a sense of theflux and evanescence of all things and so of universal illusion keenerby far than that of Anatole France; at the same time he had ethicalstandards even sterner than those of Dr.
Johnson.
This is a combinationthat the Occident has rarely seen and that it perhaps needs to see.
Atthe very end of his life Buddha uttered words that deserve to be theMagna Charta of the true individualist: “Therefore, O Ananda, be yelamps unto yourselves.
Be ye refuges unto yourselves.
Look to no outerrefuge.
Hold fast as a refuge unto the Law (Dhamma).
300 A man maysafely go into himself if what he finds there is not, like Rousseau,his own emotions, but like Buddha, the law of righteousness.
Men were induced to follow Rousseau in his surrender to the emotions,it will be remembered, because that seemed the only alternative to ahard and dry rationalism.
The rationalists of the Enlightenment werefor the most part Cartesians, but Kant himself is in his main trend arationalist.
The epithet critical usually applied to his philosophy istherefore a misnomer.
For to solve the critical problem--the relationbetween appearance and reality--it is necessary to deal adequately withthe rôle of the imagination and this Kant has quite failed to do.
301Modern philosophy is in general so unsatisfactory because it has raisedthe critical problem without carrying it through; it is too criticalto receive wisdom through the traditional channels and not criticalenough to achieve insight, and so has been losing more and more itshuman relevancy, becoming in the words of one of its recent votaries,a “narrow and unfruitful eccentricity.
The professional philosophersneed to mend their ways and that speedily if the great world is notto pass them disdainfully by and leave them to play their mysteriouslittle game among themselves.
We see one of the most recent groups, thenew realists, flat on their faces before the man of science--surely anundignified attitude for a philosopher.
It is possible to look on thekind of knowledge that science gives as alone real only by dodging thecritical problem--the problem as to the trustworthiness of the humaninstrument through which all knowledge is received--and it would beeasy to show, if this were the place to go into the more technicalaspects of the question, that the new realists have been doing justthis--whether through sheer naïveté or metaphysical despair I am unableto say.
The truly critical observer is unable to discover anythingreal in the absolute sense since everything is mixed with illusion.
In this absolute sense the man of science must ever be ignorant ofthe reality behind the shows of nature.
The new realist is, however,justified relatively in thinking that the only thing real in the viewof life that has prevailed of late has been its working according tothe natural law and the fruits of this working.
The self-deceptionbegins when he assumes that there can be no other working.
What I havemyself been opposing to naturalistic excess, such as appears in thenew realism, is insight; but insight is in itself only a word, andunless it can be shown to have its own working and its own fruits,entirely different from those of work according to the natural law, thepositivist at all events will have none of it.
The positivist will not only insist upon fruits, but will ratethese fruits themselves according to their bearing upon his mainpurpose.
Life, says Bergson, can have no purpose in the human senseof the word.
302 The positivist will reply to Bergson and to theRousseauistic drifter in general, in the words of Aristotle, that theend is the chief thing of all and that the end of ends is happiness.
Tothe Baconian who wants work and purpose but according to the naturallaw alone, the complete positivist will reply that happiness cannot beshown to result from this one-sided working; that in itself it affordsno escape from the misery of moral solitude, that we move towards truecommunion and so towards peace and happiness only by work accordingto the human law.
Now the more individualistic we are, I have beensaying, the more we must depend for the apprehension of this law onthe imagination, the imagination, let me hasten to add, supplementedby the intellect.
It is not enough to put the brakes on the naturalman--and that is what work according to the human law means--we mustdo it intelligently.
Right knowing must here as elsewhere precederight doing.
Even a Buddha admitted that at one period in his lifehe had not been intelligent in his self-discipline.
I need only toamplify here what I have said in a previous chapter about the properuse of the “false secondary power” by those who wish to be eitherreligious or humanistic in a positive fashion.
They will employ theiranalytical faculties, not in building up some abstract system, but indiscriminating between the actual data of experience with a view tohappiness, just as the man of science at his best employs the samefaculties in discriminating between the data of experience with a viewto power and utility.
I have pointed out another important use of the analytical intellect inits relation to the imagination.
Since the imagination by itself givesunity but does not give reality, it is possible to discover whether aunification of life has reality only by subjecting it to the keenestanalysis.
Otherwise what we take to be wisdom may turn out to be onlyan empty dream.
To take as wise something that is unreal is to fallinto sophistry.
For a man like Rousseau whose imagination was in itsultimate quality not ethical at all but overwhelmingly idyllic to setup as an inspired teacher was to become an arch-sophist.
Whether or nothe was sincere in his sophistry is a question which the emotionalistis very fond of discussing, but which the sensible person will dismissas somewhat secondary.
Sophistry of all kinds always has a powerfulally in man’s moral indolence.
It is so pleasant to let one’s self goand at the same time deem one’s self on the way to wisdom.
We need tokeep in mind the special quality of Rousseau’s sophistry if we wish tounderstand a very extraordinary circumstance during the past century.
During this period men were moving steadily towards the naturalisticlevel, where the law of cunning and the law of force prevail, andat the same time had the illusion--or at least multitudes had theillusion--that they were moving towards peace and brotherhood.
Theexplanation is found in the endless tricks played upon the uncriticaland still more upon the half-critical by the Arcadian imagination.
The remedy is not only a more stringent criticism, but, as I havetried to make plain in this whole work, in an age of sophistry, likethe present, criticism itself amounts largely to that art of inductivedefining which it is the great merit of Socrates, according toAristotle,303 to have devised and brought to perfection.
Sophistryflourishes, as Socrates saw, on the confused and ambiguous use ofgeneral terms; and there is an inexhaustible source of such ambiguitiesand confusions in the very duality of human nature.
The word natureitself may serve as an illustration.
We may take as a closely alliedexample the word progress.
Man may progress according to either thehuman or the natural law.
Progress according to the natural law hasbeen so rapid since the rise of the Baconian movement that it hasquite captivated man’s imagination and stimulated him to still furtherconcentration and effort along naturalistic lines.
The very magicof the word progress seems to blind him to the failure to progressaccording to the human law.
The more a word refers to what is above thestrictly material level, the more it is subject to the imagination andtherefore to sophistication.
It is not easy to sophisticate the wordhorse, it is only too easy to sophisticate the word justice.
One mayaffirm, indeed, not only that man is governed by his imagination butthat in all that belongs to his own special domain the imaginationitself is governed by words.
304We should not therefore surrender our imaginations to a general termuntil it has been carefully defined, and to define it carefully weneed usually to practice upon it what Socrates would call a dichotomy.
I have just been dichotomizing or “cutting in two” the word progress.
When the two main types of progress, material and moral, have beendiscriminated in their fruits, the positivist will proceed to ratethese fruits according to their relevancy to his main goal--the goalof happiness.
The person who is thus fortified by a Socratic dialecticwill be less ready to surrender his imagination to the first sophistwho urges him to be “progressive.
He will wish to make sure first thathe is not progressing towards the edge of a precipice.
Rousseau would have us get rid of analysis in favor of the “heart.
No small part of my endeavor in this work and elsewhere has been toshow the different meanings that may attach to the term heart (and theclosely allied terms “soul” and “intuition”)--meanings that are a worldapart, when tested by their fruits.
Heart may refer to outer perceptionand the emotional self or to inner perception and the ethical self.
Theheart of Pascal is not the heart of Rousseau.
With this distinctiononce obliterated the way is open for the Rousseauistic corruption ofsuch words as virtue and conscience, and this is to fling wide the doorto every manner of confusion.
The whole vocabulary that is properlyapplicable only to the supersensuous realm is then transferred to theregion of the subrational.
The impulsive self proceeds to cover itsnakedness with all these fair phrases as it would with a garment.
Arecent student of war-time psychology asks: “Is it that the naturalman in us has been masquerading as the spiritual man by hiding himselfunder splendid words--courage, patriotism, justice--and now he rises upand glares at us with blood-red eyes?” That is precisely what has beenhappening.
But after all the heart in any sense of the word is controlled bythe imagination, so that a still more fundamental dichotomy, perhapsthe most fundamental of all, is that of the imagination itself.
Wehave seen how often the Arcadian dreaming of the emotional naturalisthas been labelled the “ideal.
Our views of this type of imaginationwill therefore determine our views of much that now passes currentas idealism.
Now the term idealist may have a sound meaning: it maydesignate the man who is realistic according to the human law.
Butto be an idealist in Shelley’s sense or that of innumerable otherRousseauists is to fall into sheer unreality.
This type of idealistshrinks from the sharp discriminations of the critic: they are likethe descent of a douche of ice-water upon his hot illusions.
But itis pleasanter, after all, to be awakened by a douche of ice-waterthan by an explosion of dynamite under the bed; and that has been thefrequent fate of the romantic idealist.
It is scarcely safe to neglectany important aspect of reality in favor of one’s private dream, evenif this dream be dubbed the ideal.
The aspect of reality that one isseeking to exclude finally comes crashing through the walls of theivory tower and abolishes the dream and at times the dreamer.
The transformation of the Arcadian dreamer into the Utopist is averitable menace to civilization.
The ends that the Utopist proposesare often in themselves desirable and the evils that he denounces arereal.
But when we come to scrutinize critically his means, what wefind is not a firm grip on the ascertained facts of human nature butwhat Bagehot calls the feeble idealities of the romantic imagination.
Moreover various Utopists may come together as to what they wish todestroy, which is likely to include the whole existing social order;but what they wish to erect on the ruins of this order will be foundto be not only in dreamland, but in different dreamlands.
For with theelimination of the veto power from personality--the only power that canpull men back to some common centre--the ideal will amount to littlemore than the projection of this or that man’s temperament upon thevoid.
In a purely temperamental world an affirmative reply may be givento the question of Euryalus in Virgil: “Is each man’s God but his ownfell desire?” (An sua cuique deus fit dira cupido?)The task of the Socratic critic at the present time is, then, seento consist largely in stripping idealistic disguises from egoism, inexposing what I have called sham spirituality.
If the word spiritualitymeans anything, it must imply, it should seem, some degree of escapefrom the ordinary self, an escape that calls in turn for effortaccording to the human law.
Even when he is not an open and avowedadvocate of a “wise passiveness,” the Rousseauistic idealist is onlytoo manifestly not making any such effort--it would interfere with hispassion for self-expression which is even more deeply rooted in himthan his passion for saving society.
He inclines like Rousseau tolook upon every constraint305 whether from within or from withoutas incompatible with liberty.
A right definition of liberty is almostas important as a right definition of imagination and derives fromit very directly.
Where in our anarchical age will such a definitionbe found, a definition that is at once modern and in accord with thepsychological facts? “A man has only to declare himself free,” saysGoethe, “and he will at once feel himself dependent.
If he ventures todeclare himself dependent, he will feel himself free.
In other wordshe is not free to do whatever he pleases unless he wishes to enjoy thefreedom of the lunatic, but only to adjust himself to the reality ofeither the natural or the human law.
A progressive adjustment to thehuman law gives ethical efficiency, and this is the proper correctiveof material efficiency, and not love alone as the sentimentalist is sofond of preaching.
Love is another word that cries aloud for Socratictreatment.
A liberty that means only emancipation from outer control will result,I have tried to show, in the most dangerous form of anarchy--anarchyof the imagination.
On the degree of our perception of this fact willhinge the soundness of our use of another general term--democracy.
We should beware above all of surrendering our imaginations to thisword until it has been hedged about on every side with discriminationsthat have behind them all the experience of the past with this formof government.
Only in this way may the democrat know whether he isaiming at anything real or merely dreaming of the golden age.
Here aselsewhere there are pitfalls manifold for the uncritical enthusiast.
Ademocracy that produces in sufficient numbers sound individualists wholook up imaginatively to standards set above their ordinary selves, maywell deserve enthusiasm.
A democracy, on the other hand, that is notrightly imaginative, but is impelled by vague emotional intoxications,may mean all kinds of lovely things in dreamland, but in the real worldit will prove an especially unpleasant way of returning to barbarism.
It is a bad sign that Rousseau, who is more than any other one personthe father of radical democracy, is also the first of the greatanti-intellectualists.
Enough has been said to show the proper rôle of the secondary powerof analysis that the Rousseauist looks upon with so much disfavor.
Itis the necessary auxiliary of the art of defining that can alone saveus in an untraditional age from receiving some mere phantasmagoria ofthe intellect or emotions as a radiant idealism.
A Socratic dialecticof this kind is needed at such a time not only to dissipate sophistrybut as a positive support to wisdom.
I have raised the question inmy Introduction whether the wisdom that is needed just now should beprimarily humanistic or religious.
The preference I have expressedfor a positive and critical humanism I wish to be regarded as verytentative.
In the dark situation that is growing up in the Occident,all genuine humanism and religion, whether on a traditional or acritical basis, should be welcome.
I have pointed out that traditionalhumanism and religion conflict in certain respects, that it isdifficult to combine the imitation of Horace with the imitation ofChrist.
This problem does not disappear entirely when humanism andreligion are dealt with critically and is indeed one of the mostobscure that the thinker has to face.
The honest thinker, whatever hisown preference, must begin by admitting that though religion can getalong without humanism, humanism cannot get along without religion.
The reason has been given by Burke in pointing out the radical defectof Rousseau: the whole ethical life of man has its root in humility.
As humility diminishes, conceit or vain imagining rushes in almostautomatically to take its place.
Under these circumstances decorum, thesupreme virtue of the humanist, is in danger of degenerating into someart of going through the motions.
Such was only too often the decorumof the French drawing-room, and such we are told, has frequently beenthe decorum of the Chinese humanist.
Yet the decorum of Confuciushimself was not only genuine but he has put the case for the humanistwith his usual shrewdness.
I venture to ask about death,” one of hisdisciples said to him.
While you do not know life,” Confucius replied,“how can you know about death?”306The solution of this problem as to the relation between humanism andreligion, so far as a solution can be found, lies in looking upon themboth as only different stages in the same path.
Humanism should havein it an element of religious insight: it is possible to be a humbleand meditative humanist.
The type of the man of the world who is nota mere worldling is not only attractive in itself but has actuallybeen achieved in the West, though not perhaps very often, from theGreeks down.
Chinese who should be in a position to know affirm againthat, alongside many corrupt mandarins, a certain number of trueConfucians307 have been scattered through the centuries from the timeof the sage to the present.
If humanism may be religious, religion may have its humanistic side.
Ihave said, following Aristotle, that the law of measure does not applyto the religious life, but this saying is not to be understood in anabsolute sense.
Buddha is continually insisting on the middle path inthe religious life itself.
The resulting urbanity in Buddha and hisearly followers in India is perhaps the closest approach that that veryunhumanistic land has ever made to humanism.
It is right here in this joining of humanism and religion thatAristotle, at least the Aristotle that has come down to us, does notseem altogether adequate.
He fails to bring out sufficiently thebond between the meditative or religious life that he describes atthe end of his “Ethics” and the humanistic life or life of mediationto which most of this work is devoted.
An eminent French authorityon Aristotle,308 complains that this separation of the two livesencouraged the ascetic excess of the Middle Ages, the undue spurningof the world in favor of mystic contemplation.
I am struck ratherby the danger of leaving the humanistic life without any support inreligion.
In a celebrated passage,309 Aristotle says that the“magnanimous” man or ideal gentleman sees all things including himselfproportionately: he puts himself neither too high nor too low.
Andthis is no doubt true so far as other men are concerned.
But does themagnanimous man put human nature itself in its proper place? Does hefeel sufficiently its nothingness and helplessness, its dependence ona higher power? No one, indeed, who gets beyond words and outer formswould maintain that humility is a Christian monopoly.
Pindar is farmore humble310 than Aristotle, as humble, one might almost maintain,as the austere Christian.
A humanism sufficiently grounded in humility is not only desirableat all times but there are reasons for thinking that it would beespecially desirable to-day.
In the first place, it would so far asthe emotional naturalist is concerned raise a clear-cut issue.
Thenaturalist of this type denies rather than corrupts humanism.
He is thefoe of compromise and inclines to identify mediation and mediocrity.
On the other hand, he corrupts rather than denies religion, turningmeditation into pantheistic revery and in general setting up a subtleparody of what is above the ordinary rational level in terms of thesubrational.
On their own showing Rousseau and his followers areextremists,311 and even more effective perhaps than to attack themdirectly for their sham religion would be to maintain against them thatthus to violate the law of measure is to cease to be human.
Furthermore, a critical humanism would appear to be the propercorrective of the other main forms of naturalistic excess at thepresent time--the one-sided devotion to physical science.
What keepsthe man of science from being himself a humanist is not his science buthis pseudo-science, and also the secret push for power and prestigethat he shares with other men.
The reasons for putting humanistictruth above scientific truth are not metaphysical but very practical:the discipline that helps a man to self-mastery is found to have amore important bearing on his happiness than the discipline that helpshim to a mastery of physical nature.
If scientific discipline is notsupplemented by a truly humanistic or religious discipline the resultis unethical science, and unethical science is perhaps the worstmonster that has yet been turned loose on the race.
Man in spite ofwhat I have termed his stupidity, his persistent evasion of the mainissue, the issue of his own happiness, will awaken sooner or laterto the fearful evil he has already suffered from a science that hasarrogated to itself what does not properly belong to it; and thenscience may be as unduly depreciated as it has, for the past centuryor two, been unduly magnified; so that in the long run it is in theinterest of science itself to keep in its proper place, which is belowboth humanism and religion.
It would be possible to frame in the name of insight an indictmentagainst science that would make the indictment Rousseau has framedagainst it in the name of instinct seem mild.
The critical humanist,however, will leave it to others to frame such an indictment.
Nothingis more foreign to his nature than every form of obscurantism.
Heis ready indeed to point out that the man of science has in commonwith him at least one important idea--the idea of habit, though itsscientific form seems to him very incomplete.
One may illustrate fromperhaps the best known recent treatment of the subject, that of Jamesin his “Psychology.
It is equally significant that the humanist canagree with nearly every line of James’s chapter on habit and thathe disagrees very gravely with James in his total tendency.
That isbecause James shows himself, as soon as he passes from the naturalisticto the humanistic level, wildly romantic.
Even when dealing with the“Varieties of Religious Experience” he is plainly more preoccupiedwith the intensity than with the centrality of this experience.
312He is obsessed with the idea that comes down to him straight from theage of original genius that to be at the centre is to be commonplace.
In a letter to C.
E.
Norton (June 30, 1904) James praises Ruskin’sLetters and adds: “Mere sanity is the most philistine and at bottomunessential of a man’s attributes.
Mere sanity” is not to be thusdismissed, because to lack sanity is to be headed towards misery andeven madness.
Ruskin’s,” says Norton, who was in a position to know,“was essentially one of the saddest of lives.
313 Is a man to liveone of the saddest of lives merely to gratify romantic lovers of thevivid and picturesque like James?However, if the man of science holds fast to the results reached byJames and others regarding habit and at the same time avoids James’sromantic fallacies he might perceive the possibility of extending theidea of habit beyond the naturalistic level; and the way would thenbe open for an important coöperation between him and the humanist.
Humanists themselves, it must be admitted, even critical humanists,have diverged somewhat in their attitude towards habit, and that fromthe time of Socrates and Aristotle.
I have been dwelling thus far onthe indispensableness of a keen Socratic dialectic and of the rightknowledge it brings for those who aspire to be critical humanists.
But does right knowing in itself suffice to ensure right doing?Socrates and Plato with their famous identification of knowledge andvirtue would seem to reply in the affirmative.
Aristotle has theimmediate testimony of consciousness on his side when he remarkssimply regarding this identification: The facts are otherwise.
314No experience is sadder or more universal than that of the failureof right knowledge to secure right performance: so much so that theaustere Christian has been able to maintain with some plausibilitythat all the knowledge in the world is of no avail without a specialdivine succor.
Now the Aristotelian agrees with the Christian that mereknowledge is insufficient: conversion is also necessary.
He does notincline, however, like the austere Christian to look for conversion to“thunderclaps and visible upsets of grace.
Without denying necessarilythese pistol-shot transformations of human nature he conceives ofman’s turning away from his ordinary self--and here he is much nearerin temper to the man of science--as a gradual process.
This gradualconversion the Aristotelian hopes to achieve by work according tothe human law.
Now right knowledge though it supplies the norm, isnot in itself this working, which consists in the actual pulling backof impulse.
But an act of this kind to be effective must be repeated.
A habit is thus formed until at last the new direction given to thenatural man becomes automatic and unconscious.
The humanistic workermay thus acquire at last the spontaneity in right doing that thebeautiful soul professes to have received as a free gift from “nature.
Confucius narrates the various stages of knowledge and moral effortthrough which he had passed from the age of fifteen and concludes: “Atseventy I could follow what my heart desired without transgressing thelaw of measure.
315The keener the observer the more likely he is to be struck by theempire of habit.
Habit, as Wellington said, is ten times nature, andis indeed so obviously a second nature that many of the wise havesuspected that nature herself is only a first habit.
316 Now Aristotlewho is open to criticism, it may be, on the side of humility, stillremains incomparable among the philosophers of the world for histreatment of habit on the humanistic level.
Any one who wishes to learnhow to become moderate and sensible and decent can do no better even atthis late day than to steep himself in the “Nicomachean Ethics.
One of the ultimate contrasts that presents itself in a subject ofthis kind is that between habit as conceived by Aristotle and natureas conceived by Rousseau.
The first great grievance of the criticalhumanist against Rousseau is that he set out to be an individualistand at the same time attacked analysis, which is indispensable ifone is to be a sound individualist.
The second great grievance of thehumanist is that Rousseau sought to discredit habit which is necessaryif right analysis is to be made effective.
The only habit the childshould be allowed to form,” says Rousseau, “is that of forming nohabit.
317 How else is the child to follow his bent or genius andso arrive at full self-expression? The point I am bringing up is ofthe utmost gravity, for Rousseau is by common consent the father ofmodern education.
To eliminate from education the idea of a progressiveadjustment to a human law, quite apart from temperament, may be toimperil civilization itself.
For civilization (another word that issadly in need of Socratic defining) may be found to consist above allin an orderly transmission of right habits; and the chief agency forsecuring such a transmission must always be education, by which I meanfar more of course than mere formal schooling.
Rousseau’s repudiation of habit is first of all, it should be pointedout, perfectly chimerical.
The trait of the child to which the sensibleeducator will give chief attention is not his spontaneity, but hisproneness to imitate.
In the absence of good models the child willimitate bad ones, and so, long before the age of intelligent choice andself-determination, become the prisoner of bad habits.
Men, therefore,who aim at being civilized must come together, work out a conventionin short, regarding the habits they wish transmitted to the young.
A great civilization is in a sense only a great convention.
A saneindividualist does not wish to escape from convention in itself;he merely remembers that no convention is final--that it is alwayspossible to improve the quality of the convention in the midst of whichhe is living, and that it should therefore be held flexibly.
He wouldoppose no obstacles to those who are rising above the conventionallevel, but would resist firmly those who are sinking beneath it.
Itis much easier to determine practically whether one has to do with anascent or a descent (even though the descent be rapturous like thatof the Rousseauist) than our anarchical individualists are willing toacknowledge.
The notion that in spite of the enormous mass of experience that hasbeen accumulated in both East and West we are still without light asto the habits that make for moderation and good sense and decency, andthat education is therefore still purely a matter of exploration andexperiment is one that may be left to those who are suffering from anadvanced stage of naturalistic intoxication--for example, to ProfessorJohn Dewey and his followers.
From an ethical point of view a child hasthe right to be born into a cosmos, and not, as is coming to be moreand more the case under such influences, pitch-forked into chaos.
Butthe educational radical, it may be replied, does stress the idea ofhabit; and it is true that he would have the young acquire the habitsthat make for material efficiency.
This, however, does not go beyondRousseau who came out very strongly for what we should call nowadaysvocational training.
318 It is the adjustment to the human law againstwhich Rousseau and all the Rousseauists are recalcitrant.
Self-expression and vocational training combined in variousproportions and tempered by the spirit of “service,” are nearly thewhole of the new education.
But I have already said that it is notpossible to extract from any such compounding of utilitarian andromantic elements, with the resulting material efficiency and ethicalinefficiency, a civilized view of life.
It is right here indeed inthe educational field that concerted opposition to the naturalisticconspiracy against civilization is most likely to be fruitful.
Ifthe present generation--and I have in mind especially Americanconditions--cannot come to a working agreement about the ethicaltraining it wishes given the young, if it allows the drift towardsanarchy on the human level to continue, it will show itself, howeverecstatic it may be over its own progressiveness and idealism, bothcowardly and degenerate.
It is very stupid, assuming that it is notvery hypocritical, to denounce Kultur, and then to adopt educationalideas that work out in much the same fashion as Kultur, and haveindeed the same historical derivation.
The dehumanizing influences I have been tracing are especially to bedeprecated in higher education.
The design of higher education, so faras it deserves the name, is to produce leaders, and on the quality ofthe leadership must depend more than on any other single factor thesuccess or failure of democracy.
I have already quoted Aristotle’ssaying that “most men would rather live in a disorderly than in asober manner.
This does not mean much more than that most men wouldlike to live temperamentally, to follow each his own bent and thenput the best face on the matter possible.
Most men, says Goethe in asimilar vein, prefer error to truth because truth imposes limitationsand error does not.
It is well also to recall Aristotle’s saying that“the multitude is incapable of making distinctions.
319 Now my wholeargument is that to be sound individualists we must not only make theright distinctions but submit to them until they become habitual.
Does it follow that the whole experiment in which we are engaged isforedoomed to failure? Not quite--though the obstacles to success aresomewhat greater than our democratic enthusiasts suspect.
The mostdisreputable aspect of human nature, I have said, is its proneness tolook for scapegoats; and my chief objection to the movement I havebeen studying is that more perhaps than any other in history it hasencouraged the evasion of moral responsibility and the setting up ofscapegoats.
But as an offset to this disreputable aspect of man, onemay note a creditable trait: he is very sensitive to the force of aright example.
If the leaders of a community look up to a sound modeland work humanistically with reference to it, all the evidence goes toshow that they will be looked up to and imitated in turn by enough ofthe rank and file to keep that community from lapsing into barbarism.
Societies always decay from the top.
It is therefore not enough, asthe humanitarian would have us believe, that our leaders should actvigorously on the outer world and at the same time be filled with thespirit of “service.
Purely expansive leaders of this kind we haveseen who have the word humanity always on their lips and are at thesame time ceasing to be human.
That wherein the superior man cannotbe equalled,” says Confucius, “is simply this--his work which othermen cannot see.
320 It is this inner work and the habits that resultfrom it that above all humanize a man and make him exemplary to themultitude.
To perform this work he needs to look to a centre and amodel.
We are brought back here to the final gap that opens between classicistand romanticist.
To look to a centre according to the romanticistis at the best to display “reason,” at the worst to be smug andphilistine.
To look to a true centre is, on the contrary, accordingto the classicist, to grasp the abiding human element through all thechange in which it is implicated, and this calls for the highest useof the imagination.
The abiding human element exists, even though itcannot be exhausted by dogmas and creeds, is not subject to rules andrefuses to be locked up in formulæ.
A knowledge of it results fromexperience,--experience vivified by the imagination.
To do justice towriting which has this note of centrality we ourselves need to be insome measure experienced and imaginative.
Writing that is romantic,writing in which the imagination is not disciplined to a true centreis best enjoyed while we are young.
The person who is as much taken byShelley at forty as he was at twenty has, one may surmise, failed togrow up.
Shelley himself wrote to John Gisborne (October 22, 1821): “Asto real flesh and blood, you know that I do not deal in those articles;you might as well go to a ginshop for a leg of mutton as expectanything human or earthly from me.
The mature man is likely to bedissatisfied with poetry so unsubstantial as this even as an intoxicantand still more when it is offered to him as the “ideal.
The very markof genuinely classical work, on the other hand, is that it yields itsfull meaning only to the mature.
Young and old are, as Cardinal Newmansays, affected very differently by the words of some classic author,such as Homer or Horace.
Passages, which to a boy are but rhetoricalcommonplaces, neither better nor worse than a hundred others which anyclever writer might supply … at length come home to him, when longyears have passed, and he has had experience of life, and pierce him,as if he had never before known them, with their sad earnestness andvivid exactness.
Then he comes to understand how it is that lines, thebirth of some chance morning or evening at an Ionian festival or amongthe Sabine hills, have lasted generation after generation for thousandsof years, with a power over the mind and a charm which the currentliterature of his own day, with all its obvious advantages, is utterlyunable to rival.
In the poets whom Newman praises the imagination is, as it were,centripetal.
The neo-classic proneness to oppose good sense toimagination, and the romantic proneness to oppose imagination to goodsense, have at least this justification, that in many persons, perhapsin most persons, the two actually conflict, but surely the point toemphasize is that they may come together, that good sense may beimaginative and imagination sensible.
If imagination is not sensible,as is plainly the case in Victor Hugo, for example, we may suspect alack of the universal and ethical quality.
All men, even great poets,are more or less immersed in their personal conceit and in the zones ofillusion peculiar to their age.
But there is the question of degree.
The poets to whom the world has finally accorded its suffrage have notbeen megalomaniacs; they have not threatened like Hugo to outbellowthe thunder or pull comets around by the tail.
321 Bossuet’s sayingthat “good sense is the master of human life” does not contradict butcomplete Pascal’s saying that “the imagination disposes of everything,”provided only due stress be laid on the word human.
It would not beeasy to live a more imaginative life than Hugo, but his imagination wasso unrestrained that we may ask whether he lived a very human life,whether he was not rather, in Tennyson’s phrase, a “weird Titan.
Manrealizes that immensity of his being of which Joubert speaks only in sofar as he ceases to be the thrall of his own ego.
This human breadth heachieves not by throwing off but by taking on limitations, and what helimits is above all his imagination.
The reason why he should strivefor a life that is thus increasingly full and complete is simply,as Joubert suggests, that it is more delectable, that it is foundpractically to make for happiness.
THE ENDAPPENDIXCHINESE PRIMITIVISMPerhaps the closest approach in the past to the movement of whichRousseau is the most important single figure is the early Taoistmovement in China.
Taoism, especially in its popular aspects, becamelater something very different, and what I say is meant to apply aboveall to the period from about 550 to 200 B.
C.
The material for theTaoism of this period will be found in convenient form in the volumeof Léon Wieger (1913)--Les Pères du Système taoïste (Chinese textswith French translations of Lao-tzŭ, Lieh-tzŭ and Chuang-tzŭ).
The TaoTê King of Lao-tzŭ is a somewhat enigmatical document of only a fewthousand words, but plainly primitivistic in its general trend.
Thephrase that best sums up its general spirit is that of Wordsworth--a“wise passiveness.
The unity at which it aims is clearly of thepantheistic variety, the unity that is obtained by breaking downdiscrimination and affirming the “identity of contradictories,” andthat encourages a reversion to origins, to the state of nature and thesimple life.
According to the Taoist the Chinese fell from the simplelife into artificiality about the time of the legendary Yellow Emperor,Hoang-ti (27th century B.
C.
The individual also should look backto beginnings and seek to be once more like the new-born child322or, according to Chuang-tzŭ, like the new-born calf.
323 It is inChuang-tzŭ indeed that the doctrine develops its full naturalistic andprimitivistic implications.
Few writers in either East or West haveset forth more entertainingly what one may term the Bohemian attitudetowards life.
He heaps ridicule upon Confucius and in the name ofspontaneity attacks his doctrine of humanistic imitation.
324 Hesings the praises of the unconscious,325 even when obtained throughintoxication,326 and extols the morality of the beautiful soul.
327He traces the fall of mankind from nature into artifice in a fashionthat anticipates very completely both Rousseau’s Discourse on the Artsand Sciences328 and that on the Origin of Inequality.
329 See alsothe amusing passage in which the brigand Chi, child of nature andchampion of the weak against the oppressions of government, paintsa highly Rousseauistic picture of man’s fall from his primitivefelicity.
330 Among the things that are contrary to nature and purelyconventional, according to Chuang-tzŭ and the Taoists, are, not onlythe sciences and arts and attempts to discriminate between good andbad taste,331 but likewise government and statecraft,332 virtueand moral standards.
333 To the artificial music of the Confucians,the Taoists oppose a natural music that offers startling analogies tothe most recent programmatic and descriptive tendencies of Occidentalmusic.
334 See especially Chuang-tzŭ’s programme for a cosmic symphonyin three movements335--the Pipes of Pan as one is tempted to callit.
This music that is supposed to reflect in all its mystery andmagic the infinite creative processes of nature is very close to theprimitivistic music (“L’arbre vu du côté des racines”) with whichHugo’s satyr strikes panic into the breasts of the Olympians.
The Taoist notion of following nature is closely related, as in othernaturalistic movements, to the idea of fate whether in its stoicalor epicurean form.
336 From the references in Chuang-tzŭ337and elsewhere to various sects and schools we see that Taoism wasonly a part of a great stream of naturalistic and primitivistictendency.
China abounded at that time in pacifists,338 in apostlesof brotherly love, and as we should say nowadays Tolstoyans.
A trueopposite to the egoistic Yang-chu was the preacher of pure altruismand indiscriminate sympathy, Mei-ti.
Mencius said that if the ideasof either of these extremists prevailed the time would come, not onlywhen wolves would devour men, but men would devour one another.
339In opposing discrimination and ethical standards to the naturalists,Mencius and the Confucian humanists were fighting for civilization.
Unfortunately there is some truth in the Taoist charge that thestandards of the Confucians are too literal, that in their defence ofthe principle of imitation they did not allow sufficiently for theelement of flux and relativity and illusion in things--an element forwhich the Taoists had so keen a sense that they even went to the pointof suppressing the difference between sleeping and waking340 andlife and death.
341 To reply properly to the Taoist relativist theConfucians would have needed to work out a sound conception of the rôleof the imagination--the universal key to human nature--and this theydo not seem to have done.
One is inclined to ask whether this is thereason for China’s failure to achieve a great ethical art like that ofthe drama and the epic of the Occident at their best.
The Taoists wererichly imaginative but along romantic lines.
We should not fail to notethe Taoist influence upon Li Po and other Bohemian and bibulous poetsof the Tang dynasty, or the relation of Taoism to the rise of a greatschool of landscape painting at about the same time.
We should notealso the Taoist element in “Ch’an” Buddhism (the “Zen” Buddhism342 ofJapan), some knowledge of which is needed for an understanding of wholeperiods of Japanese and Chinese art.
In these later stages, however, the issues are less clear-cut thanin the original struggle between Taoists and Confucians.
The totalimpression one has of early Taoism is that it is a main manifestationof an age of somewhat sophistical individualism.
Ancient Chineseindividualism ended like that of Greece at about the same time indisaster.
After a period of terrible convulsions (the era of the“Fighting States”), the inevitable man on horseback appeared from themost barbaric of these states and “put the lid” on everybody.
ShiHwang-ti, the new emperor, had many of the scholars put to death andissued an edict that the writings of the past, especially the Confucianwritings, should be destroyed (213 B.
C.
Though the emperor behavedlike a man who took literally the Taoist views as to the blessings ofignorance, it is not clear from our chief authority, the historianSsŭ-ma Ch’ien, that he acted entirely or indeed mainly under Taoistinfluence.
It is proper to add that though Lao-tzŭ proclaims that the soft issuperior to the hard, a doctrine that should appeal to the Occidentalsentimentalist, one does not find in him or in the other Taoists theequivalent of the extreme emotional expansiveness of the Rousseauist.
There are passages, especially in Lao-tzŭ, that in their emphasis onconcentration and calm are in line with the ordinary wisdom of theEast; and even where the doctrine is unmistakably primitivistic theemotional quality is often different from that of the correspondingmovement in the West.
BIBLIOGRAPHYMy only justification for these very unsystematic bibliographical notesis that, bringing together as they do under one cover material somewhatscattered and inaccessible to most readers, they may help to add tothe number, now unfortunately very small, of those who have earnedthe right to have an opinion about romanticism as an internationalmovement.
A list of this kind is a fragment of a fragment.
I havegiven, for example, only a fraction of the books on Rousseau andscarcely any of the books, thousands in numbers, which without beingchiefly on Rousseau, contain important passages on him.
I may citealmost at random as instances of this latter class, the comparisonbetween Burke and Rousseau in the fifth volume of Lecky’s History ofthe Eighteenth Century; the stanzas on Rousseau in the third cantoof Childe Harold; the passage on Rousseau in Hazlitt’s essay on thePast and Future (Table Talk).
The only period that I have covered with any attempt at fullness isthat from about 1795 to 1840.
Books that seem to me to possess literarydistinction or to deal authoritatively with some aspect of the subjectI have marked with a star.
I make no claim, however, to have readall the books I have listed, and my rating will no doubt often bequestioned in the case of those I have read.
I have not as a rule mentioned articles in periodicals.
The files ofthe following special publications may often be consulted with profit.
Those that have current bibliographies I have marked with a dagger.

FOOTNOTES1 See, for example, in vol.
IX of the Annales de la SociétéJean-Jacques Rousseau the bibliography (pp.
87-276) for 1912--the yearof the bicentenary.
2 Literature and the American College (1908); The New Laokoon(1910); The Masters of Modern French Criticism (1912).
3 See his Oxford address On the Modern Element in Literature.
4 These two tendencies in Occidental thought go back respectively atleast as far as Parmenides and Heraclitus.
5 In his World as Imagination (1916) E.
D.
Fawcett, thoughultra-romantic and unoriental in his point of view, deals with aproblem that has always been the special preoccupation of the Hindu.
A Hindu, however, would have entitled a similar volume The Worldas Illusion (māyā).
Aristotle has much to say of fiction in hisPoetics but does not even use the word imagination (φαντασία).
In thePsychology, where he discusses the imagination, he assigns not to it,but to mind or reason the active and creative rôle (νοῦς ποιητικός).
It is especially the notion of the creative imagination that isrecent.
The earliest example of the phrase that I have noted in Frenchis in Rousseau’s description of his erotic reveries at the Hermitage(Confessions, Livre IX).
6 Essay on Flaubert in Essais de Psychologie contemporaine.
7 Le Romantisme et les mœurs (1910).
8 Annales de la Société Jean-Jacques Rousseau, VIII, 30-31.
9 I should perhaps say that in the case of Buddha I have been able toconsult the original Pāli documents.
In the case of Confucius and theChinese I have had to depend on translations.
10 See appendix on Chinese primitivism.
11 See, for example, Majjhima (Pāli Text Society), I, 265.
LaterBuddhism, especially Mahāyāna Buddhism, fell away from the positive andcritical spirit of the founder into mythology and metaphysics.
12 Buddha expressed on many occasions his disdain for the Vedas,the great traditional authority of the Hindus.
13 I have explained the reasons for giving this place to Bacon inchapter II of Literature and the American College.

15 I scarcely need remind the reader that the extant Aristotelianwritings which have repelled so many by their form were almostcertainly not meant for publication.
For the problems raised by thesewritings as well as for the mystery in the method of their earlytransmission see R.
Shute, History of the Aristotelian Writings(1888).
The writings which Aristotle prepared for publication andwhich Cicero describes as a “golden stream of speech” (Acad.
II,38, 119) have, with the possible exception of the recently recoveredConstitution of Athens, been lost.
16 See his Essai sur le genre dramatique sérieux.
17 Quoted in Grimm’s Dictionary.

30 The French Academy discriminates in its Sentiments sur le Cidbetween two types of probability, “ordinary” and “extraordinary.
Probability in general is more especially reserved for action.
In thedomain of action “ordinary” probability and decorum run very closetogether.
It is, for example, both indecorous and improbable thatChimène in the Cid should marry her father’s murderer.

He seemed to me antediluvian, with his long dyed curls andhis old-fashioned dress … with long coats reaching to the ankles,knee-breeches, and long colored waistcoats.
Also, he appeared alwayswith a young lady who adored him, and who was followed by a manservant carrying a harp.
She sat at his feet and appeared as he didin the costume of 1830, with long flowing curls called Anglaises.
In society, however, people ran after him tremendously, and spoilthim in every possible way.
He read aloud from his own works, and, inespecially poetic passages, his ‘Alice’ accompanied him with arpeggioson the harp.

Take, for example, the educationaltheory that has led to the setting up of the elective system.
Thegeneral human discipline embodied in the fixed curriculum is to bediscarded in order that the individual may be free to work along thelines of his bent or “genius.
In a somewhat similar way scientificnaturalism encourages the individual to sacrifice the general humandiscipline to a specialty.

109 The phrase imaginative insight is, I believe, true to the spiritof Plato at his best, but it is certainly not true to his terminology.
Plato puts the imagination (φαντασία) not only below intuitivereason (νοῦς) and discursive reason or understanding (διάνοια), buteven below outer perception (πίστις).
He recognizes indeed that itmay reflect the operations of the understanding and even the higherreason as well as the impressions of sense.
This notion of a superiorintellectual imagination was carried much further by Plotinus andthe neo-Platonists.
Even the intellectual imagination is, however,conceived of as passive.
Perhaps no Greek thinker, not even Plato,makes as clear as he might that reason gets its intuition of realityand the One with the aid of the imagination and, as it were, througha veil of illusion, that, in Joubert’s phrase, “l’illusion est unepartie inté, grante de la réalité” (Pensées, Titre XI, XXXIX).
Joubert again distinguishes (ibid.
Titre III, XLVII, LI) between“l’imaginative” which is passive and “l’imagination” which is activeand creative (“l’œil de l’âme”).
In its failure to bring out withsufficient explicitness this creative rôle of the imagination and inthe stubborn intellectualism that this failure implies is to be found,if anywhere, the weak point in the cuirass of Greek philosophy.

And if the driver lose his way,      Or the reins sunder, who can say      In what blind paths, what pits of fear    Will plunge the chargers in their mad career?      Drive well, O mind, use all thy art,      Thou charioteer!--O feeling Heart,      Be thou a bridle firm and strong!    For the Lord rideth and the way is long.

198 It was especially easy for the poets to go for their landscapesto the painters because according to the current theory poetry wasitself a form of painting (ut pictura poesis).
Thus Thomson writes inThe Castle of Indolence:      Sometimes the pencil, in cool airy halls,      Bade the gay bloom of vernal landskips rise,      Or autumn’s varied shades embrown the walls:      Now the black tempest strikes the astonish’d eyes;      Now down the steep the flashing torrent flies;      The trembling sun now plays o’er ocean blue,      And now rude mountains frown amid the skies;      Whate’er Lorrain light touch’d with softening hue,    Or savage Rosa dash’d, or learned Poussin drew.

It seems to float ever, for ever      Upon that many-winding river,      Between mountains, woods, abysses,      A paradise of wildernesses!    …      Meanwhile thy spirit lifts its pinions      In music’s most serene dominions;    Catching the winds that fan that happy heaven.
And we sail on away, afar,      Without a course, without a star,      But by the instinct of sweet music driven;      Till through Elysian garden islets      By thee, most beautiful of pilots,      Where never mortal pinnace glided      The boat of my desire is guided;      Realms where the air we breathe is love--                       Prometheus Unbound, Act II, Sc.

Let us hope that they did,though few things are more perilous than this transfer of the idea ofprogress to the literary and artistic domain.
Decadent Rome, as welearn from the younger Pliny and others, simply swarmed with poets whoalso no doubt indulged in many strange experiments.
All this poeticalactivity, as we can see only too plainly at this distance, led nowhere.

224 If nature merely reflects back to a man his own image, it followsthat Coleridge’s celebrated distinction between fancy and imaginationhas little value, inasmuch as he rests his proof of the unifyingpower of the imagination, in itself a sound idea, on the union theimagination effects between man and outer nature--and this union is onhis own showing fanciful.
225 If I had had this consecration Wordsworth says, addressing PeeleCastle,    I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile,    Amid a world how different from this!    Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;    On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss.

251 Keats according to Shelley was an example of the poète maudit.
